At any time during the lease, the lessee may purchase the recreational 31 cabin site. 01 (h) The commissioner shall set annual fees for a lease under this section to 02 ensure that the state receives a fair return for the use granted. After termination of a 03 recreational cabin site lease, improvements or personal property remaining on the land 04 shall be managed in the same manner provided in AS 38.05.090 for removal or 05 reversion of improvements upon termination of leases of state land. A lease under this 06 section may be assigned with the consent of the commissioner. 07 (i) The commissioner may sell land offered or nominated under this section to 08 an eligible applicant. A sale must be at fair market value, and the purchaser shall pay 09 for the appraisal, platting costs, and a survey if not already completed for the 10 recreational cabin site. For a sale to a lessee under (g) of this section, fair market value 11 shall be determined as of the time of entry, and the lessee may apply lease payments to 12 the purchase price. 13 (j) The commissioner may adopt regulations under AS 44.62 (Administrative 14 Procedures Act) necessary to implement this section. 15 (k) In this section, 16 (1) "eligible applicant" means a resident at least 18 years of age who 17 has not leased or purchased a recreational cabin site during the 10-year period before 18 submitting an application under this section; 19 (2) "resident" means an individual who has resided in the state for one 20 year immediately preceding an application under this section. 21 * Sec. 7.

At any time during the lease, the lessee may purchase the recreational 31 cabin site. 01 (h) The commissioner shall set annual fees for a lease under this section to 02 ensure that the state receives a fair return for the use granted. After termination of a 03 recreational cabin site lease, improvements or personal property remaining on the land 04 shall be managed in the same manner provided in AS 38.05.090 for removal or 05 reversion of improvements upon termination of leases of state land. A lease under this 06 section may be assigned with the consent of the commissioner. 07 (i) The commissioner may sell land offered or nominated under this section to 08 an eligible applicant. A sale must be at fair market value, and the purchaser shall pay 09 for the appraisal, platting costs, and a survey if not already completed for the 10 recreational cabin site.
