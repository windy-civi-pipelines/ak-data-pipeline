A sale by or to the United States or an entity that is exempt 23 from federal taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) (Internal Revenue Code) is exempt 24 from the tax imposed under this chapter. 25 Sec. 43.72.020. Collection of sales tax by marketplace facilitators; physical 26 presence. (a) The tax described in AS 43.72.010 is imposed on the purchaser. The 27 marketplace facilitator shall collect the tax and pay the tax to the department. A 28 marketplace facilitator shall hold all taxes collected in trust for the state. A 29 marketplace facilitator shall apply the tax to the sales price. 30 (b) The marketplace facilitator is not required to collect and remit taxes to the 31 department unless, in the previous calendar year, the 01 (1) marketplace facilitator's gross sales revenue from the sale of 02 property or services delivered in the state met or exceeded $250,000; or 03 (2) marketplace facilitator made 200 or more separate sales of property 04 or services delivered in the state. 05 (c) A marketplace facilitator shall register with the department if it satisfies 06 the conditions of (b)(1) or (2) of this section. 07 (d) A marketplace facilitator who does not have a physical presence in the 08 state is subject to the provisions of this chapter and shall remit the sales tax levied 09 under AS 43.72.010 if the marketplace facilitator satisfies one of the requirements 10 under (b) of this section and conducts sales through an online marketplace and 11 delivery is located within the state. 12 Sec. 43.72.030. Liability for payment of tax. (a) Liability for the payment of 13 a tax imposed under this chapter is not extinguished until the taxes have been paid to 14 the department. 15 (b) A marketplace facilitator is liable for the tax due under this chapter and 16 may be required to furnish adequate security as provided in AS 43.72.080 to ensure 17 collection and payment of the taxes. 18 Sec. 43.72.040. Method of accounting. A person who is a marketplace 19 facilitator shall report and pay the tax due under this chapter using the same method of 20 accounting that the person uses for federal tax purposes. 21 Sec. 43.72.050. Returns; payment. A marketplace facilitator responsible for 22 collecting the sales tax due under AS 43.72.020 shall file a return on a form or in a 23 format prescribed by the department and pay the tax to the department. The 24 marketplace facilitator shall file the return and pay the tax on or before the last day of 25 the month following the month for which the tax is due. 26 Sec. 43.72.060. Methods. (a) The department shall adopt regulations providing 27 a rounding method for payment of a tax imposed under this chapter. 28 (b) The department may use sampling principles or methods instead of 29 examining 100 percent of records in conducting an audit of a return filed under 30 AS 43.72.050. 31 Sec. 43.72.070. Deduction for bad debts. (a) A marketplace facilitator filing a 01 return under AS 43.72.050 may deduct sales found to be worthless. The bad debt may 02 be deducted when it 03 (1) is written off as uncollectable in the person's books and records; 04 and 05 (2) qualifies as a deduction for federal income tax purposes under 26 06 U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code). 07 (b) If the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales or leases 08 during the period that the bad debt is written off, a marketplace facilitator may file a 09 refund claim with the department. 10 (c) If a bad debt deducted under (a) of this section is later collected, the 11 marketplace facilitator who claimed the deduction shall pay the tax levied under 12 AS 43.72.020 on the amount collected. For purposes of this section, a payment made 13 on a debt or account is applied first to the sales price of the property or service, then to 14 interest, service charges, and any other charges. 15 Sec. 43.72.080. Security: limitations; sale of security deposit at auction; 16 bond. (a) The department may require a marketplace facilitator to deposit with the 17 department security in a form and amount that the department determines is 18 appropriate. The deposit may not be more than twice the estimated average tax 19 liability under this chapter for the period for which the return is required under 20 AS 43.72.050 to be filed or $10,000, whichever is less. The department may increase 21 or decrease the amount of security, subject to the limitations provided in this section. 22 (b) The department may sell at public auction property deposited as security to 23 recover a tax amount required to be collected under this chapter, including interest and 24 penalties. Notice of the sale must be sent at least 30 days before the sale by certified 25 mail to the last known address of the person who deposited the security. After the sale, 26 any surplus above the amount due that is not required as security under this section 27 must be returned to the person who deposited the security. 28 (c) Instead of security, the department may require a marketplace facilitator to 29 file a bond to guarantee solvency and responsibility issued by a surety company 30 authorized to transact business in this state. 31 (d) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the department may 01 require the corporate officers, directors, or shareholders of a marketplace facilitator 02 corporation to provide a personal guaranty and assumption of liability for the payment 03 of the tax due under this chapter. 04 Sec. 43.72.090. Quitting business; liability of successor. (a) Within 10 days 05 after a marketplace facilitator quits business, sells, exchanges, or otherwise transfers 06 the business, or disposes of the complete stock of goods of the business, the 07 marketplace facilitator shall file a return and pay the taxes due under this chapter. 08 (b) Except as provided in (d) of this section, a successor in a business or stock 09 of goods is liable for the payment of the full amount of tax and shall withhold from the 10 sales price payable to the predecessor a sum sufficient to pay any tax due until the 11 predecessor produces either a receipt from the department showing payment in full of 12 any tax due or a statement from the department that tax is not due. 13 (c) If a tax is due but has not been paid as provided in (a) of this section, the 14 successor is liable for the payment of the full amount of tax. The payment of the tax 15 by the successor is considered to be a payment on the sales price and, if the payment is 16 greater in amount than the sales price, the amount of the difference becomes a debt 17 due to the successor from the taxpayer owing the tax under (a) of this section. 18 (d) A successor is not liable for any tax due under this section if the successor 19 gives written notice to the department of the acquisition and the department does not 20 issue an assessment against the predecessor within six months after receipt of the 21 notice from the successor. If the department issues an assessment and a copy of the 22 assessment is not mailed to the successor, the successor is not liable for the tax due. 23 (e) In this section, "predecessor" means a marketplace facilitator that quits 24 business, sells, exchanges, or otherwise transfers the business, or disposes of the 25 complete stock of goods of the business. 26 Sec. 43.72.100. Tax as debt. (a) The tax imposed by this chapter and related 27 interest and penalties become a personal debt of a marketplace facilitator required to 28 file a return under AS 43.72.050 or a person required by the department to personally 29 guarantee the payment of taxes under this chapter from the time the liability arises, 30 regardless of when the time for payment of the liability occurs. 31 (b) If the personal representative of an estate has voluntarily distributed the 01 assets held in that capacity without reserving sufficient assets to pay the taxes due 02 under this chapter and interest and penalties resulting from taxes due under this 03 chapter, the personal representative is personally liable for the taxes, interest, and 04 penalties, to the extent permitted under AS 13.16. 05 (c) An officer or employee of a marketplace facilitator whose duty it is to 06 collect, truthfully account for, and pay to the state the taxes imposed by this chapter 07 and who fails to pay the taxes is liable to the state for the taxes imposed by this 08 chapter and the penalty and interest due on the taxes. 09 Sec. 43.72.110. Organized retail theft fund. (a) The organized retail theft 10 fund is established in the general fund. The legislature may appropriate the tax 11 collected under AS 43.72.010 to the organized retail theft fund. The legislature may 12 appropriate money in the fund to law enforcement agencies to investigate and 13 prosecute organized retail theft under AS 11.46.215 and related fraud and property 14 crimes. 15 (b) The fund is not a dedicated fund. Money in the fund does not lapse and 16 remains available for appropriation in successive fiscal years. 17 Sec. 43.72.900. Definitions.

A sale by or to the United States or an entity that is exempt 23 from federal taxation under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) (Internal Revenue Code) is exempt 24 from the tax imposed under this chapter. 25 Sec. 43.72.020.

The 27 marketplace facilitator shall collect the tax and pay the tax to the department. A 28 marketplace facilitator shall hold all taxes collected in trust for the state. A 29 marketplace facilitator shall apply the tax to the sales price. 30 (b) The marketplace facilitator is not required to collect and remit taxes to the 31 department unless, in the previous calendar year, the 01 (1) marketplace facilitator's gross sales revenue from the sale of 02 property or services delivered in the state met or exceeded $250,000; or 03 (2) marketplace facilitator made 200 or more separate sales of property 04 or services delivered in the state. 05 (c) A marketplace facilitator shall register with the department if it satisfies 06 the conditions of (b)(1) or (2) of this section. 07 (d) A marketplace facilitator who does not have a physical presence in the 08 state is subject to the provisions of this chapter and shall remit the sales tax levied 09 under AS 43.72.010 if the marketplace facilitator satisfies one of the requirements 10 under (b) of this section and conducts sales through an online marketplace and 11 delivery is located within the state. 12 Sec. 43.72.030. Liability for payment of tax. (a) Liability for the payment of 13 a tax imposed under this chapter is not extinguished until the taxes have been paid to 14 the department. 15 (b) A marketplace facilitator is liable for the tax due under this chapter and 16 may be required to furnish adequate security as provided in AS 43.72.080 to ensure 17 collection and payment of the taxes. 18 Sec. 43.72.040. Method of accounting. A person who is a marketplace 19 facilitator shall report and pay the tax due under this chapter using the same method of 20 accounting that the person uses for federal tax purposes. 21 Sec. 43.72.050. Returns; payment. A marketplace facilitator responsible for 22 collecting the sales tax due under AS 43.72.020 shall file a return on a form or in a 23 format prescribed by the department and pay the tax to the department. The 24 marketplace facilitator shall file the return and pay the tax on or before the last day of 25 the month following the month for which the tax is due. 26 Sec. 43.72.060. Methods. (a) The department shall adopt regulations providing 27 a rounding method for payment of a tax imposed under this chapter. 28 (b) The department may use sampling principles or methods instead of 29 examining 100 percent of records in conducting an audit of a return filed under 30 AS 43.72.050. 31 Sec. 43.72.070. Deduction for bad debts. (a) A marketplace facilitator filing a 01 return under AS 43.72.050 may deduct sales found to be worthless. The bad debt may 02 be deducted when it 03 (1) is written off as uncollectable in the person's books and records; 04 and 05 (2) qualifies as a deduction for federal income tax purposes under 26 06 U.S.C. (Internal Revenue Code). 07 (b) If the amount of bad debt exceeds the amount of taxable sales or leases 08 during the period that the bad debt is written off, a marketplace facilitator may file a 09 refund claim with the department. 10 (c) If a bad debt deducted under (a) of this section is later collected, the 11 marketplace facilitator who claimed the deduction shall pay the tax levied under 12 AS 43.72.020 on the amount collected. For purposes of this section, a payment made 13 on a debt or account is applied first to the sales price of the property or service, then to 14 interest, service charges, and any other charges. 15 Sec. 43.72.080. Security: limitations; sale of security deposit at auction; 16 bond. (a) The department may require a marketplace facilitator to deposit with the 17 department security in a form and amount that the department determines is 18 appropriate. The deposit may not be more than twice the estimated average tax 19 liability under this chapter for the period for which the return is required under 20 AS 43.72.050 to be filed or $10,000, whichever is less. The department may increase 21 or decrease the amount of security, subject to the limitations provided in this section. 22 (b) The department may sell at public auction property deposited as security to 23 recover a tax amount required to be collected under this chapter, including interest and 24 penalties. Notice of the sale must be sent at least 30 days before the sale by certified 25 mail to the last known address of the person who deposited the security. After the sale, 26 any surplus above the amount due that is not required as security under this section 27 must be returned to the person who deposited the security. 28 (c) Instead of security, the department may require a marketplace facilitator to 29 file a bond to guarantee solvency and responsibility issued by a surety company 30 authorized to transact business in this state. 31 (d) In addition to the other requirements of this section, the department may 01 require the corporate officers, directors, or shareholders of a marketplace facilitator 02 corporation to provide a personal guaranty and assumption of liability for the payment 03 of the tax due under this chapter. 04 Sec. 43.72.090. Quitting business; liability of successor. (a) Within 10 days 05 after a marketplace facilitator quits business, sells, exchanges, or otherwise transfers 06 the business, or disposes of the complete stock of goods of the business, the 07 marketplace facilitator shall file a return and pay the taxes due under this chapter. 08 (b) Except as provided in (d) of this section, a successor in a business or stock 09 of goods is liable for the payment of the full amount of tax and shall withhold from the 10 sales price payable to the predecessor a sum sufficient to pay any tax due until the 11 predecessor produces either a receipt from the department showing payment in full of 12 any tax due or a statement from the department that tax is not due. 13 (c) If a tax is due but has not been paid as provided in (a) of this section, the 14 successor is liable for the payment of the full amount of tax. The payment of the tax 15 by the successor is considered to be a payment on the sales price and, if the payment is 16 greater in amount than the sales price, the amount of the difference becomes a debt 17 due to the successor from the taxpayer owing the tax under (a) of this section. 18 (d) A successor is not liable for any tax due under this section if the successor 19 gives written notice to the department of the acquisition and the department does not 20 issue an assessment against the predecessor within six months after receipt of the 21 notice from the successor. If the department issues an assessment and a copy of the 22 assessment is not mailed to the successor, the successor is not liable for the tax due. 23 (e) In this section, "predecessor" means a marketplace facilitator that quits 24 business, sells, exchanges, or otherwise transfers the business, or disposes of the 25 complete stock of goods of the business. 26 Sec. 43.72.100. Tax as debt. (a) The tax imposed by this chapter and related 27 interest and penalties become a personal debt of a marketplace facilitator required to 28 file a return under AS 43.72.050 or a person required by the department to personally 29 guarantee the payment of taxes under this chapter from the time the liability arises, 30 regardless of when the time for payment of the liability occurs. 31 (b) If the personal representative of an estate has voluntarily distributed the 01 assets held in that capacity without reserving sufficient assets to pay the taxes due 02 under this chapter and interest and penalties resulting from taxes due under this 03 chapter, the personal representative is personally liable for the taxes, interest, and 04 penalties, to the extent permitted under AS 13.16. 05 (c) An officer or employee of a marketplace facilitator whose duty it is to 06 collect, truthfully account for, and pay to the state the taxes imposed by this chapter 07 and who fails to pay the taxes is liable to the state for the taxes imposed by this 08 chapter and the penalty and interest due on the taxes. 09 Sec. 43.72.110. Organized retail theft fund. (a) The organized retail theft 10 fund is established in the general fund. The legislature may appropriate the tax 11 collected under AS 43.72.010 to the organized retail theft fund. The legislature may 12 appropriate money in the fund to law enforcement agencies to investigate and 13 prosecute organized retail theft under AS 11.46.215 and related fraud and property 14 crimes. 15 (b) The fund is not a dedicated fund. Money in the fund does not lapse and 16 remains available for appropriation in successive fiscal years. 17 Sec. 43.72.900. Definitions.
