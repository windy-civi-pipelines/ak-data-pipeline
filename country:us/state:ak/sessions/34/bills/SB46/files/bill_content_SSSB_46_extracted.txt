AS 14.17.410(b) is amended to read: 12 (b) Public school funding consists of state aid, a required local contribution, 13 and eligible federal impact aid determined as follows: 14 (1) state aid equals the amount appropriated by the legislature for 01 public school funding; except as otherwise provided in this section, a district's 02 basic need equals the amount of the district's state aid calculated under (g) of this 03 section plus the district's [MINUS A] required local contribution and 90 percent of 04 the district's eligible federal impact aid for that fiscal year; [BASIC NEED EQUALS 05 THE SUM OBTAINED UNDER (D) OF THIS PARAGRAPH, MULTIPLIED BY 06 THE BASE STUDENT ALLOCATION SET OUT IN AS 14.17.470;] district 07 adjusted ADM is calculated as follows: 08 (A) the ADM of each school in the district is calculated by 09 applying the school size factor to the student count as set out in AS 14.17.450; 10 (B) the number obtained under (A) of this paragraph is 11 multiplied by the district cost factor described in AS 14.17.460; 12 (C) the ADMs of each school in a district, as adjusted 13 according to (A) and (B) of this paragraph, are added; the sum is then 14 multiplied by the special needs factor set out in AS 14.17.420(a)(1) and the 15 secondary school vocational and technical instruction funding factor set out in 16 AS 14.17.420(a)(3); 17 (D) the number obtained for intensive services under 18 AS 14.17.420(a)(2) and the number obtained for correspondence study under 19 AS 14.17.430 are added to the number obtained under (C) of this paragraph or 20 under (H) and (I) of this paragraph; 21 (E) notwithstanding (A) - (C) of this paragraph, if a school 22 district's ADM adjusted for school size under (A) of this paragraph decreases 23 by five percent or more from one fiscal year to the next fiscal year, the school 24 district may use the last fiscal year before the decrease as a base fiscal year to 25 offset the decrease, according to the following method: 26 (i) for the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year 27 determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted 28 for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as 29 the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 75 percent of the 30 difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the 31 base fiscal year and the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 01 (ii) for the second fiscal year after the base fiscal year 02 determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted 03 for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as 04 the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 50 percent of the 05 difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the 06 base fiscal year and the second fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 07 (iii) for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year 08 determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted 09 for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as 10 the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 25 percent of the 11 difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the 12 base fiscal year and the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 13 (F) the method established in (E) of this paragraph is available 14 to a school district for the three fiscal years following the base fiscal year 15 determined under (E) of this paragraph only if the district's ADM adjusted for 16 school size determined under (A) of this paragraph for each fiscal year is less 17 than the district's ADM adjusted for school size in the base fiscal year; 18 (G) the method established in (E) of this paragraph does not 19 apply to a decrease in the district's ADM adjusted for school size resulting 20 from a loss of enrollment that occurs as a result of a boundary change under 21 AS 29; 22 (H) notwithstanding (A) - (C) of this paragraph, if one or more 23 schools close and consolidate with one or more other schools in the same 24 community and district and, as a result of the consolidation, basic need 25 generated by the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under 26 (A) - (C) of this paragraph decreases, the district may use the last fiscal year 27 before the consolidation as the base fiscal year to offset that decrease for the 28 first four fiscal years following consolidation according to the following 29 method: 30 (i) for the first two fiscal years after the base fiscal year, 31 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - 01 (C) of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's 02 ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 03 paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of 04 the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, 05 and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the district's ADM of 06 the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under 07 (A) - (C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's ADM of the 08 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, 09 multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 10 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, and 11 adding that number to the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated 12 schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 13 paragraph; 14 (ii) for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the 15 district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) 16 of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's 17 ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 18 paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of 19 the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, 20 and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 21 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 22 adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's 23 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year, 24 multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 25 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, 26 multiplying that number by 66 percent, and adding that number to the 27 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current 28 fiscal year as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph; 29 (iii) for the fourth fiscal year after the base fiscal year, 30 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - 31 (C) of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's 01 ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 02 paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of 03 the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, 04 and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 05 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 06 adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's 07 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year, 08 multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 09 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, 10 multiplying that number by 33 percent, and adding that number to the 11 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current 12 fiscal year as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph; 13 (iv) to calculate the district's basic need for each fiscal 14 year, the number obtained through the calculation in (i), (ii), or (iii) of 15 this subparagraph is added to the number obtained under (C) of this 16 paragraph for the remainder of the district; 17 (I) if the basic need calculated under (H)(i) - (iii) of this 18 paragraph for one of the first four fiscal years after consolidation is less than 19 the basic need calculated under (A) - (C) of this paragraph for that fiscal year, 20 the basic need may not be adjusted under (H) of this paragraph for that fiscal 21 year; 22 (J) a district may not offset a decrease under (H) of this 23 paragraph if 24 (i) a new facility is constructed in the district for the 25 consolidation; or 26 (ii) the district offset a decrease under (E) of this 27 paragraph in the same fiscal year; 28 (K) a district that offsets a decrease under (H) of this paragraph 29 may not reopen a school that was closed for consolidation in the district until 30 (i) seven or more years have passed since the school 31 closure;
