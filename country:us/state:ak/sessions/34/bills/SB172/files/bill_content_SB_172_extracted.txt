Notice of intent to 19 suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority 20 and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, and each of the Member 21 States. 22 (4) A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, 23 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including 24 obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. 25 (5) The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is 26 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed 27 upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State. 28 (6) The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by 29 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district 30 where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be 31 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 01 (C) Dispute Resolution 02 (1) Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to 03 resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between 04 member and non-Member States. 05 (2) The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both 06 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. 07 (D) Enforcement 08 (1) The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall 09 enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact. 10 (2) By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the 11 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where 12 the Commission has its principal offices against a Member State in default to enforce 13 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules and bylaws. 14 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial 15 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such 16 litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 17 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the 18 Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal 19 or State law. 20 SECTION 12. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE 21 COMMISSION FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED 22 RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT 23 (A) The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact 24 statute is enacted into law in the tenth Member State.

Thereafter, the Commission shall 27 meet and exercise Rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and 28 administration of the Compact. 29 (B) Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial 30 adoption of the Rules shall be subject to the Rules as they exist on the date on which 31 the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by 01 the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact 02 becomes law in that State. 03 (C) Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute 04 repealing the same. 05 (1) A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) 06 months after enactment of the repealing statute. 07 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the 08 withdrawing State's Occupational Therapy Licensing Board to comply with the 09 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this act prior to the 10 effective date of withdrawal. 11 (D) Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or 12 prevent any Occupational Therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative 13 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict 14 with the provisions of this Compact. 15 (E) This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to 16 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is 17 enacted into the laws of all Member States. 18 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY 19 This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 20 thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, 21 sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of 22 any Member State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any 23 government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the 24 remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, 25 person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held 26 contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full 27 force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to 28 the Member State affected as to all severable matters. 29 SECTION 14.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, 28 in the event the Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is 29 beyond the scope of the purposes of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, 30 then such an action by the Commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect. 31 (C) If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule, by 01 enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact 02 within 4 years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no further 03 force and effect in any Member State. 04 (D) Rules or amendments to the Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special 05 meeting of the Commission. 06 (E) Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final Rule or Rules by the 07 Commission, and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Rule 08 will be considered and voted upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed 09 Rulemaking: 10 (1) On the website of the Commission or other publicly accessible 11 platform; and 12 (2) On the website of each Member State Occupational Therapy 13 Licensing Board or other publicly accessible platform or the publication in which each 14 State would otherwise publish proposed Rules. 15 (F) The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include: 16 (1) The proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the 17 Rule will be considered and voted upon; 18 (2) The text of the proposed Rule or amendment and the reason for the 19 proposed Rule; 20 (3) A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any interested 21 person; and 22 (4) The manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the 23 Commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments. 24 (G) Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall allow persons 25 to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available 26 to the public. 27 (H) The Commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it 28 adopts a Rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by: 29 (1) At least twenty five (25) persons; 30 (2) A State or federal governmental subdivision or agency; or 31 (3) An association or organization having at least twenty five (25) 01 members. 02 (I) If a hearing is held on the proposed Rule or amendment, the Commission 03 shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing. If the hearing is 04 held via electronic means, the Commission shall publish the mechanism for access to 05 the electronic hearing. 06 (1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the 07 executive director of the Commission or other designated member in writing of their 08 desire to appear and testify at the hearing not less than five (5) business days before 09 the scheduled date of the hearing. 10 (2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person 11 who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in 12 writing. 13 (3) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording will be made 14 available on request. 15 (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate 16 hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission 17 at hearings required by this section. 18 (J) Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the 19 scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the Commission shall consider all 20 written and oral comments received. 21 (K) If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested 22 parties is received, the Commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed 23 Rule without a public hearing. 24 (L) The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action 25 on the proposed Rule and shall determine the effective date of the Rule, if any, based 26 on the Rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule. 27 (M) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission may 28 consider and adopt an emergency Rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, 29 or hearing, provided that the usual Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact 30 and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably 31 possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For 01 the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted 02 immediately in order to: 03 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; 04 (2) Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds; 05 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative Rule that 06 is established by federal law or Rule; or 07 (4) Protect public health and safety. 08 (N) The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission may 09 direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule or amendment for purposes of correcting 10 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. 11 Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The 12 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days 13 after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results 14 in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to 15 the chair of the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is 16 made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, 17 the revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission. 18 SECTION 11. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT 19 (A) Oversight 20 (1) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of State 21 government in each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions 22 necessary and appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and intent. The 23 provisions of this Compact and the Rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing 24 as statutory law. 25 (2) All courts shall take judicial notice of the Compact and the Rules in 26 any judicial or administrative proceeding in a Member State pertaining to the subject 27 matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the 28 Commission. 29 (3) The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in 30 any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 31 purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Commission shall render a 01 judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules. 02 (B) Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination 03 (1) If the Commission determines that a Member State has defaulted in 04 the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the 05 promulgated Rules, the Commission shall: 06 (a) Provide written notice to the defaulting State and other 07 Member States of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the 08 default and/or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and 09 (b) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance 10 regarding the default. 11 (2) If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State 12 may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the 13 Member States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact may 14 be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not 15 relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of 16 default. 17 (3) Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only 18 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to 19 suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority 20 and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, and each of the Member 21 States. 22 (4) A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, 23 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including 24 obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. 25 (5) The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is 26 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed 27 upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State. 28 (6) The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by 29 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district 30 where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be 31 awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 01 (C) Dispute Resolution 02 (1) Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall attempt to 03 resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member States and between 04 member and non-Member States. 05 (2) The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for both 06 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. 07 (D) Enforcement 08 (1) The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall 09 enforce the provisions and Rules of this Compact. 10 (2) By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the 11 United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where 12 the Commission has its principal offices against a Member State in default to enforce 13 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules and bylaws. 14 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial 15 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such 16 litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 17 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the 18 Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal 19 or State law. 20 SECTION 12. DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERSTATE 21 COMMISSION FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTICE AND ASSOCIATED 22 RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT 23 (A) The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the Compact 24 statute is enacted into law in the tenth Member State. The provisions, which become 25 effective at that time, shall be limited to the powers granted to the Commission 26 relating to assembly and the promulgation of Rules. Thereafter, the Commission shall 27 meet and exercise Rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and 28 administration of the Compact. 29 (B) Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the Commission's initial 30 adoption of the Rules shall be subject to the Rules as they exist on the date on which 31 the Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by 01 the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact 02 becomes law in that State. 03 (C) Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute 04 repealing the same. 05 (1) A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) 06 months after enactment of the repealing statute. 07 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the 08 withdrawing State's Occupational Therapy Licensing Board to comply with the 09 investigative and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this act prior to the 10 effective date of withdrawal. 11 (D) Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or 12 prevent any Occupational Therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative 13 arrangement between a Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict 14 with the provisions of this Compact. 15 (E) This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No amendment to 16 this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member State until it is 17 enacted into the laws of all Member States. 18 SECTION 13. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY 19 This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 20 thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, 21 sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of 22 any Member State or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any 23 government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the 24 remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, 25 person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact shall be held 26 contrary to the constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full 27 force and effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to 28 the Member State affected as to all severable matters. 29 SECTION 14. BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS 30 (A) A Licensee providing Occupational Therapy in a Remote State under the 31 Compact Privilege shall function within the laws and regulations of the Remote State. 01 (B) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a Member 02 State that is not inconsistent with the Compact. 03 (C) Any laws in a Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded 04 to the extent of the conflict. 05 (D) Any lawful actions of the Commission, including all Rules and bylaws 06 promulgated by the Commission, are binding upon the Member States. 07 (E) All agreements between the Commission and the Member States are 08 binding in accordance with their terms. 09 (F) In the event any provision of the Compact exceeds the constitutional limits 10 imposed on the legislature of any Member State, the provision shall be ineffective to 11 the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that Member 12 State.
