allocated for the Anchorage Correctional Complex includes the unexpended and 10 unobligated balance on June 30, 2025, of federal receipts received by the Department of 11 Corrections through manday

facilities. The legislature urges the Department to coordinate with the Department of Law to 15 either receive adequate daily funding for federal inmates housed in State facilities or to 16 determine a method for them to be housed at a federal or private facility until court hearings. 17 DOC and Department of Law shall then submit a joint response to the Co-chairs of the 18 Finance committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, outlining 19 the determined terms, number of federal inmates housed in State facilities by day in 2025 and 20 the final cost associated to the State, if any. 21 Anvil Mountain Correctional 9,538,000 22 Center 23 Combined Hiland Mountain 20,456,800 24 Correctional Center 25 Fairbanks Correctional 16,687,100 26 Center 27 Goose Creek Correctional 54,929,200 28 Center 29 Ketchikan Correctional 6,387,200 30 Center 31 Lemon Creek Correctional 15,245,700 01 Center 02 Matanuska-Susitna 8,754,100 03 Correctional Center 04 Palmer Correctional Center 21,192,500 05 Spring Creek Correctional 23,215,100 06 Center 07 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections permanently close one 08 housing unit at Spring Creek Correctional Facility. Closing one unit will allow the 09 Department to direct personnel resources to other areas of the facility, reduce overtime, and 10 find efficiencies. The Department shall provide a report to the Co-chairs of the Finance 11 committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, detailing the 12 efforts taken towards closing a housing unit, and resulting cost savings and efficiencies. 13 Wildwood Correctional 20,184,700 14 Center 15 Yukon-Kuskokwim 12,762,400 16 Correctional Center 17 Point MacKenzie 5,985,100 18 Correctional Farm 19 Probation and Parole 1,440,400 20 Director's Office 21 Pre-Trial Services 16,823,000 22 Statewide Probation and 19,405,200 23 Parole 24 Regional and Community 8,189,400 25 Jails 26 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections continue the reform of the 27 Regional and Community Jails program. Since the program's inception, public safety has 28 changed in the state and jails are not utilized to the same extent. Therefore, the Department 29 should renegotiate FY27 contracts by reducing the bed count by two-thirds if the individual 30 community's unused bed rate was over sixty percent, when FY24 and FY25 are averaged, and 31 any other corresponding costs. This realignment prevents closures and allows communities to 01 maintain a jail with a more appropriate bed count and cost to the State. The Department shall 02 issue a status report to the to the Co-chairs of the Finance committees and to the Legislative 03 Finance Division by December 20, 2025. 04 Parole Board 1,938,800 05 Community Residential Centers 14,651,300 14,651,300 06 Community Residential 14,651,300 07 Centers 08 Electronic Monitoring 2,826,200 2,826,200 09 Electronic Monitoring 2,826,200 10 The amount allocated for Electronic Monitoring includes the unexpended and unobligated 11 balance on June 30, 2025, of program receipts from electronic monitoring fees. 12 Health and Rehabilitation Services 83,931,900 72,307,200 11,624,700 13 Health and Rehabilitation 1,742,400 14 Director's Office 15 Physical Health Care 69,569,800 16 Behavioral Health Care 4,439,900 17 Substance Abuse Treatment 4,217,600 18 Program 19 Sex Offender Management 3,097,600 20 Program 21 Domestic Violence Program 175,000 22 Reentry Unit 689,600 23 Offender Habilitation 1,619,700 1,463,400 156,300 24 Education Programs 1,013,700 25 Vocational Education 606,000 26 Programs 27 Recidivism Reduction Grants 1,766,700 766,700 1,000,000 28 Recidivism Reduction Grants 1,766,700 29 * * * * * * * * * * 30 * * * * * Department of Education and Early Development * * * * * 31 * * * * * * * * * * 01 K-12 Aid to School Districts 20,791,000 20,791,000 02 Foundation Program 20,791,000 03 K-12 Support 13,717,500 13,717,500 04 Residential Schools Program 8,535,800 05 Youth in Detention 1,100,000 06 Special Schools 4,081,700 07 Education Support and Admin Services 314,754,100 67,237,900 247,516,200 08 Executive Administration 1,943,200 09 Administrative Services 4,235,600 10 Information Services 2,357,600 11 Broadband Assistance Grants 21,001,300 12 School Finance & Facilities 2,901,000 13 It is the intent of the legislature that a school district report to the Department twice annually, 14 once by the end of the count period set out in AS 14.17.500, and on February 1, 2026, the 15 balance of each of the following funds: 1) school operating fund, 2) special revenue funds, 3) 16 capital project funds, 4) other governmental funds.

billings. 12 It is the intent of the legislature the State of Alaska, through the Department of Corrections 13 (DOC), no longer covers the full cost of unsentenced federal inmates housed in State 14 facilities. The legislature urges the Department to coordinate with the Department of Law to 15 either receive adequate daily funding for federal inmates housed in State facilities or to 16 determine a method for them to be housed at a federal or private facility until court hearings. 17 DOC and Department of Law shall then submit a joint response to the Co-chairs of the 18 Finance committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, outlining 19 the determined terms, number of federal inmates housed in State facilities by day in 2025 and 20 the final cost associated to the State, if any. 21 Anvil Mountain Correctional 9,538,000 22 Center 23 Combined Hiland Mountain 20,456,800 24 Correctional Center 25 Fairbanks Correctional 16,687,100 26 Center 27 Goose Creek Correctional 54,929,200 28 Center 29 Ketchikan Correctional 6,387,200 30 Center 31 Lemon Creek Correctional 15,245,700 01 Center 02 Matanuska-Susitna 8,754,100 03 Correctional Center 04 Palmer Correctional Center 21,192,500 05 Spring Creek Correctional 23,215,100 06 Center 07 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections permanently close one 08 housing unit at Spring Creek Correctional Facility. Closing one unit will allow the 09 Department to direct personnel resources to other areas of the facility, reduce overtime, and 10 find efficiencies. The Department shall provide a report to the Co-chairs of the Finance 11 committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, detailing the 12 efforts taken towards closing a housing unit, and resulting cost savings and efficiencies. 13 Wildwood Correctional 20,184,700 14 Center 15 Yukon-Kuskokwim 12,762,400 16 Correctional Center 17 Point MacKenzie 5,985,100 18 Correctional Farm 19 Probation and Parole 1,440,400 20 Director's Office 21 Pre-Trial Services 16,823,000 22 Statewide Probation and 19,405,200 23 Parole 24 Regional and Community 8,189,400 25 Jails 26 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections continue the reform of the 27 Regional and Community Jails program. Since the program's inception, public safety has 28 changed in the state and jails are not utilized to the same extent. Therefore, the Department 29 should renegotiate FY27 contracts by reducing the bed count by two-thirds if the individual 30 community's unused bed rate was over sixty percent, when FY24 and FY25 are averaged, and 31 any other corresponding costs. This realignment prevents closures and allows communities to 01 maintain a jail with a more appropriate bed count and cost to the State.
