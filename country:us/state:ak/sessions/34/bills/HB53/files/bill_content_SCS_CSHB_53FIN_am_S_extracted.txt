unsentenced federal inmates housed in State 16 facilities. The legislature urges the Department to coordinate with the Department of Law to 17 either receive adequate daily funding for federal inmates housed in State facilities or to 18 determine a method for them to be housed at a federal or private facility until court hearings. 19 DOC and Department of Law shall then submit a joint response to the Co-chairs of the 20 Finance committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, outlining 21 the determined terms, number of federal inmates housed in State facilities by day in 2025 and 22 the final cost associated to the State, if any. 23 Anvil Mountain Correctional 9,593,100 24 Center 25 Combined Hiland Mountain 20,589,100 26 Correctional Center 27 Fairbanks Correctional 16,801,500 28 Center 29 Goose Creek Correctional 55,320,200 30 Center 31 Ketchikan Correctional 6,422,400 01 Center 02 Lemon Creek Correctional 15,362,000 03 Center 04 Matanuska-Susitna 8,810,300 05 Correctional Center 06 Palmer Correctional Center 21,321,200 07 Spring Creek Correctional 23,382,000 08 Center 09 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections permanently close one 10 housing unit at Spring Creek Correctional Facility. Closing one unit will allow the 11 Department to direct personnel resources to other areas of the facility, reduce overtime, and 12 find efficiencies. The Department shall provide a report to the Co-chairs of the Finance 13 committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, detailing the 14 efforts taken towards closing a housing unit, and resulting cost savings and efficiencies. 15 Wildwood Correctional 20,341,000 16 Center 17 Yukon-Kuskokwim 12,842,500 18 Correctional Center 19 Point MacKenzie 6,028,000 20 Correctional Farm 21 Probation and Parole 1,484,500 22 Director's Office 23 Pre-Trial Services 17,493,600 24 Statewide Probation and 20,420,400 25 Parole 26 Regional and Community 8,189,400 27 Jails 28 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections continue the reform of the 29 Regional and Community Jails program. Since the program's inception, public safety has 30 changed in the state and jails are not utilized to the same extent. Therefore, the Department 31 should renegotiate FY27 contracts by reducing the bed count by two-thirds if the individual 01 community's unused bed rate was over sixty percent, when FY24 and FY25 are averaged, and 02 any other corresponding costs. This realignment prevents closures and allows communities to 03 maintain a jail with a more appropriate bed count and cost to the State. The Department shall 04 issue a status report to the to the Co-chairs of the Finance committees and to the Legislative 05 Finance Division by December 20, 2025. 06 Parole Board 2,017,500 07 Community Residential Centers 14,651,300 14,651,300 08 Community Residential 14,651,300 09 Centers 10 Electronic Monitoring 2,932,900 2,932,900 11 Electronic Monitoring 2,932,900 12 The amount allocated for Electronic Monitoring includes the unexpended and unobligated 13 balance on June 30, 2025, of program receipts from electronic monitoring fees. 14 Health and Rehabilitation Services 85,811,700 74,177,500 11,634,200 15 Health and Rehabilitation 1,810,800 16 Director's Office 17 Physical Health Care 71,141,000 18 Behavioral Health Care 4,592,500 19 Substance Abuse Treatment 4,236,300 20 Program 21 Sex Offender Management 3,131,100 22 Program 23 Domestic Violence Program 175,000 24 Reentry Unit 725,000 25 Offender Habilitation 1,646,900 1,490,600 156,300 26 Education Programs 1,040,900 27 Vocational Education 606,000 28 Programs 29 Recidivism Reduction Grants 1,766,700 766,700 1,000,000 30 Recidivism Reduction Grants 1,766,700 31 * * * * * * * * * * 01 * * * * * Department of Education and Early Development * * * * * 02 * * * * * * * * * * 03 K-12 Aid to School Districts 20,791,000 20,791,000 04 Foundation Program 20,791,000 05 K-12 Support 13,717,500 13,717,500 06 Residential Schools Program 8,535,800 07 Youth in Detention 1,100,000 08 Special Schools 4,081,700 09 Education Support and Admin Services 315,665,600 67,783,300 247,882,300 10 Executive Administration 1,961,700 11 Administrative Services 4,316,600 12 Information Services 2,424,900 13 Broadband Assistance Grants 21,011,100 14 School Finance & Facilities 2,989,500 15 It is the intent of the legislature that a school district report to the Department twice annually, 16 once by the end of the count period set out in AS 14.17.500, and on February 1, 2026, the 17 balance of each of the following funds: 1) school operating fund, 2) special revenue funds, 3) 18 capital project funds, 4) other governmental funds.

unsentenced federal inmates housed in State 16 facilities. The legislature urges the Department to coordinate with the Department of Law to 17 either receive adequate daily funding for federal inmates housed in State facilities or to 18 determine a method for them to be housed at a federal or private facility until court hearings. 19 DOC and Department of Law shall then submit a joint response to the Co-chairs of the 20 Finance committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, outlining 21 the determined terms, number of federal inmates housed in State facilities by day in 2025 and 22 the final cost associated to the State, if any. 23 Anvil Mountain Correctional 9,593,100 24 Center 25 Combined Hiland Mountain 20,589,100 26 Correctional Center 27 Fairbanks Correctional 16,801,500 28 Center 29 Goose Creek Correctional 55,320,200 30 Center 31 Ketchikan Correctional 6,422,400 01 Center 02 Lemon Creek Correctional 15,362,000 03 Center 04 Matanuska-Susitna 8,810,300 05 Correctional Center 06 Palmer Correctional Center 21,321,200 07 Spring Creek Correctional 23,382,000 08 Center 09 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections permanently close one 10 housing unit at Spring Creek Correctional Facility. Closing one unit will allow the 11 Department to direct personnel resources to other areas of the facility, reduce overtime, and 12 find efficiencies. The Department shall provide a report to the Co-chairs of the Finance 13 committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, detailing the 14 efforts taken towards closing a housing unit, and resulting cost savings and efficiencies. 15 Wildwood Correctional 20,341,000 16 Center 17 Yukon-Kuskokwim 12,842,500 18 Correctional Center 19 Point MacKenzie 6,028,000 20 Correctional Farm 21 Probation and Parole 1,484,500 22 Director's Office 23 Pre-Trial Services 17,493,600 24 Statewide Probation and 20,420,400 25 Parole 26 Regional and Community 8,189,400 27 Jails 28 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections continue the reform of the 29 Regional and Community Jails program. Since the program's inception, public safety has 30 changed in the state and jails are not utilized to the same extent. Therefore, the Department 31 should renegotiate FY27 contracts by reducing the bed count by two-thirds if the individual 01 community's unused bed rate was over sixty percent, when FY24 and FY25 are averaged, and 02 any other corresponding costs. This realignment prevents closures and allows communities to 03 maintain a jail with a more appropriate bed count and cost to the State.
