The legislature urges the Department to coordinate with the Department of Law to 25 either receive adequate daily funding for federal inmates housed in State facilities or to 26 determine a method for them to be housed at a federal or private facility until court hearings. 27 DOC and Department of Law shall then submit a joint response to the Co-chairs of the 28 Finance committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, outlining 29 the determined terms, number of federal inmates housed in State facilities by day in 2025 and 30 the final cost associated to the State, if any. 31 Anvil Mountain Correctional 9,730,600 01 Center 02 Combined Hiland Mountain 20,701,300 03 Correctional Center 04 Fairbanks Correctional 16,932,900 05 Center 06 Goose Creek Correctional 55,303,400 07 Center 08 Ketchikan Correctional 6,529,100 09 Center 10 Lemon Creek Correctional 15,546,500 11 Center 12 Matanuska-Susitna 8,995,400 13 Correctional Center 14 Palmer Correctional Center 21,437,000 15 Spring Creek Correctional 23,523,600 16 Center 17 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections permanently close one 18 housing unit at Spring Creek Correctional Facility. Closing one unit will allow the 19 Department to direct personnel resources to other areas of the facility, reduce overtime, and 20 find efficiencies. The Department shall provide a report to the Co-chairs of the Finance 21 committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, detailing the 22 efforts taken towards closing a housing unit, and resulting cost savings and efficiencies. 23 Wildwood Correctional 20,432,600 24 Center 25 Yukon-Kuskokwim 12,988,500 26 Correctional Center 27 Point MacKenzie 6,136,200 28 Correctional Farm 29 Probation and Parole 1,638,500 30 Director's Office 31 Pre-Trial Services 17,943,500 01 Statewide Probation and 21,152,400 02 Parole 03 Regional and Community 8,909,400 04 Jails 05 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections continue the reform of the 06 Regional and Community Jails program. Since the program's inception, public safety has 07 changed in the state and jails are not utilized to the same extent. Therefore, the Department 08 should renegotiate FY27 contracts by reducing the bed count by two-thirds if the individual 09 community's unused bed rate was over sixty percent, when FY24 and FY25 are averaged, and 10 any other corresponding costs. This realignment prevents closures and allows communities to 11 maintain a jail with a more appropriate bed count and cost to the State. The Department shall 12 issue a status report to the to the Co-chairs of the Finance committees and to the Legislative 13 Finance Division by December 20, 2025. 14 Parole Board 2,017,500 15 Community Residential Centers 18,030,100 18,030,100 16 Community Residential 18,030,100 17 Centers 18 Electronic Monitoring 3,067,100 3,067,100 19 Electronic Monitoring 3,067,100 20 The amount allocated for Electronic Monitoring includes the unexpended and unobligated 21 balance on June 30, 2025, of program receipts from electronic monitoring fees. 22 Health and Rehabilitation Services 86,060,300 74,426,100 11,634,200 23 Health and Rehabilitation 1,811,800 24 Director's Office 25 Physical Health Care 71,342,800 26 Behavioral Health Care 4,638,300 27 Substance Abuse Treatment 4,236,300 28 Program 29 Sex Offender Management 3,131,100 30 Program 31 Domestic Violence Program 175,000 01 Reentry Unit 725,000 02 Offender Habilitation 1,646,900 1,490,600 156,300 03 Education Programs 1,040,900 04 Vocational Education 606,000 05 Programs 06 Recidivism Reduction Grants 1,766,700 766,700 1,000,000 07 Recidivism Reduction Grants 1,766,700 08 * * * * * * * * * * 09 * * * * * Department of Education and Early Development * * * * * 10 * * * * * * * * * * 11 K-12 Aid to School Districts 20,791,000 20,791,000 12 Foundation Program 20,791,000 13 K-12 Support 13,717,500 13,717,500 14 Residential Schools Program 8,535,800 15 Youth in Detention 1,100,000 16 Special Schools 4,081,700 17 Education Support and Admin Services 316,159,500 68,275,800 247,883,700 18 Executive Administration 1,961,700 19 Administrative Services 4,320,500 20 Information Services 2,424,900 21 Broadband Assistance Grants 21,011,100 22 School Finance & Facilities 2,989,500 23 It is the intent of the legislature that a school district report to the Department twice annually, 24 once by the end of the count period set out in AS 14.17.500, and on February 1, 2026, the 25 balance of each of the following funds: 1) school operating fund, 2) special revenue funds, 3) 26 capital project funds, 4) other governmental funds.

The legislature urges the Department to coordinate with the Department of Law to 25 either receive adequate daily funding for federal inmates housed in State facilities or to 26 determine a method for them to be housed at a federal or private facility until court hearings. 27 DOC and Department of Law shall then submit a joint response to the Co-chairs of the 28 Finance committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, outlining 29 the determined terms, number of federal inmates housed in State facilities by day in 2025 and 30 the final cost associated to the State, if any. 31 Anvil Mountain Correctional 9,730,600 01 Center 02 Combined Hiland Mountain 20,701,300 03 Correctional Center 04 Fairbanks Correctional 16,932,900 05 Center 06 Goose Creek Correctional 55,303,400 07 Center 08 Ketchikan Correctional 6,529,100 09 Center 10 Lemon Creek Correctional 15,546,500 11 Center 12 Matanuska-Susitna 8,995,400 13 Correctional Center 14 Palmer Correctional Center 21,437,000 15 Spring Creek Correctional 23,523,600 16 Center 17 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections permanently close one 18 housing unit at Spring Creek Correctional Facility.

The Department shall provide a report to the Co-chairs of the Finance 21 committees and to the Legislative Finance Division by December 20, 2025, detailing the 22 efforts taken towards closing a housing unit, and resulting cost savings and efficiencies. 23 Wildwood Correctional 20,432,600 24 Center 25 Yukon-Kuskokwim 12,988,500 26 Correctional Center 27 Point MacKenzie 6,136,200 28 Correctional Farm 29 Probation and Parole 1,638,500 30 Director's Office 31 Pre-Trial Services 17,943,500 01 Statewide Probation and 21,152,400 02 Parole 03 Regional and Community 8,909,400 04 Jails 05 It is the intent of the legislature that the Department of Corrections continue the reform of the 06 Regional and Community Jails program. Since the program's inception, public safety has 07 changed in the state and jails are not utilized to the same extent. Therefore, the Department 08 should renegotiate FY27 contracts by reducing the bed count by two-thirds if the individual 09 community's unused bed rate was over sixty percent, when FY24 and FY25 are averaged, and 10 any other corresponding costs. This realignment prevents closures and allows communities to 11 maintain a jail with a more appropriate bed count and cost to the State.
