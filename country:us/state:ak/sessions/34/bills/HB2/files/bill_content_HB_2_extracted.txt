In making a determination under this section, the 01 court 02 (1) shall consider whether a diversion agreement will benefit the 03 defendant and the community; 04 (2) may take into consideration whether 05 (A) there was an early recognition by the defendant during any 06 previous court proceedings that a course of diagnosis and treatment of problem 07 drinking, alcoholism, or substance abuse would be beneficial; 08 (B) there is reasonable probability that the defendant will 09 cooperate with the diagnostic assessment and treatment agencies; 10 (C) the defendant will observe the restrictions contained in the 11 diversion agreement; 12 (D) the offense was committed in a motor vehicle and there 13 was a passenger in the motor vehicle who was under 18 years of age and at 14 least three years younger than the defendant; 15 (3) shall deny the petition if 16 (A) after the date the defendant filed the petition, the defendant 17 was charged or convicted under AS 28.35.030, 28.35.032, or a similar law in 18 another jurisdiction for a different criminal episode; 19 (B) the defendant failed to appear at an arraignment on the 20 present offense without good cause; 21 (C) after the date the defendant filed the petition, the defendant 22 entered into the driving while under the influence diversion program or any 23 similar court-ordered alcohol or drug rehabilitation program, other than a 24 program entered into as a result of the charge for the present offense, in this 25 state or in another jurisdiction; 26 (D) after the date the defendant filed the petition, the defendant 27 was charged with or convicted of an offense under AS 11.41.100 - 11.41.230 28 that resulted from the operation of a motor vehicle in this state or in another 29 jurisdiction; 30 (E) the defendant has been convicted of a prior offense under 31 AS 28.35.030 or 28.35.032; 01 (4) may not deny the petition because the defendant is a member of the 02 military and has been called or might be called to active duty and the military service 03 will impair the defendant's ability to complete the diversion program; 04 (5) may not deny the petition because the defendant has sought out or 05 entered into a treatment program that is not court-ordered, before the court issues a 06 decision on the petition, or because the defendant has participated in court-ordered 07 treatment in another case. 08 (j) If a court grants a petition for admittance into the driving while under the 09 influence diversion program, the court shall accept the guilty plea or no contest plea 10 filed as part of the petition under (e) of this section, but shall withhold entry of a 11 judgment of conviction. The court shall sign the petition and indicate the date the 12 diversion period begins and ends and the date on which the driving while under the 13 influence offense occurred. A diversion agreement shall be for a period of one year 14 after the date the court grants the petition. During the diversion period, the court shall 15 stay further criminal offense proceedings pending completion of the diversion 16 agreement or termination of the diversion agreement. If the defendant has not already 17 been processed by the Department of Corrections or a municipal correctional facility 18 on the charge of driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, 19 or controlled substance under AS 28.35.030 or refusal to submit to a chemical test 20 under AS 28.35.032, the court shall require the defendant to submit to processing. 21 (k) The signed and dated petition is the diversion agreement between the 22 defendant and the court. The court shall make the diversion agreement part of the 23 record of the case. The court shall notify the Department of Administration of the 24 diversion agreement within 48 hours after granting the petition. 25 (l) If the court denies a petition submitted under (e) of this section, the court 26 shall proceed with the criminal case on the charges brought against the defendant. The 27 guilty plea or no contest plea filed as part of the petition for admittance into the 28 driving while under the influence diversion program under (e) of this section may not 29 be used in the offense proceeding. A statement by the defendant about the offense 30 made during the course of screening or a treatment program to a person employed by 31 the treatment program may not be offered or received as evidence in any criminal or 01 civil action or proceeding arising out of the conduct on which the charge of driving 02 while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, or controlled substance 03 under AS 28.35.030, or the charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test under 04 AS 28.35.032, is based. 05 (m) The court may allow a defendant who is an active duty member of the 06 military to participate in a comparable treatment program conducted by or authorized 07 by a government entity in another jurisdiction to satisfy a treatment program 08 requirement as part of the defendant's diversion agreement. 09 (n) If a victim impact program exists in the community in which the defendant 10 resides, a court may order the defendant to attend a victim impact treatment session as 11 part of the defendant's diversion agreement. If the court orders attendance under this 12 subsection, the court may require the defendant to pay a fee of not less than $5 and not 13 more than $50 to the victim impact program to offset the cost of the defendant's 14 participation. 15 (o) A defendant may file a motion for an extension of the diversion period 16 within 30 days before the end of the diversion period or, if the defendant is an active 17 duty member of the military, at any time before the end of the diversion period. 18 (p) The court may grant a motion for extension of the driving while under the 19 influence diversion program if the court finds the defendant made a good faith effort 20 to complete the conditions of the diversion agreement and the defendant is able to 21 complete the conditions of the diversion agreement within the requested extended 22 diversion period. Only one extension may be granted for not more than 180 days from 23 the date the original diversion period ended, unless the defendant is an active duty 24 member of the military or is a member of the military that has received active duty 25 orders and the defendant demonstrates the military service will impair the defendant's 26 ability to complete the conditions of the diversion agreement and no comparable 27 treatment program is available. 28 (q) If the court grants a motion for extension, the defendant shall fully comply 29 with the conditions of the diversion agreement within the extended diversion period. If 30 the court finds the defendant failed to comply with the diversion agreement within the 31 extended diversion period, the court shall enter a guilty plea or no contest plea filed as 01 part of the petition under (e) of this section, shall enter a judgment of conviction, and 02 shall sentence the defendant. 03 (r) If the court denies a motion for extension, the court shall enter the guilty 04 plea or no contest plea included in the petition under (e) of this section, shall enter a 05 judgment of conviction, and shall sentence the defendant. 06 (s) At any time before the completion of a defendant's diversion period and 07 dismissal with prejudice, the court may, on its own motion or on the motion of the 08 prosecuting attorney, issue an order requiring the defendant to appear and show cause 09 as to why the court should not terminate the diversion agreement. The order to show 10 cause must 11 (1) state the reasons for the proposed termination; 12 (2) specify the amount of any fees owed and, if the amount owed is 13 $500 or less, inform the defendant that the court may dismiss with prejudice the 14 charge of driving while under the influence if the person has complied with and 15 performed all of the conditions of the diversion agreement and pays the remaining 16 amount before or on the date of the hearing; and 17 (3) set an appearance date. 18 (t) At an order to show cause hearing, the court 19 (1) shall terminate the diversion agreement and 20 (A) enter the guilty plea or no contest plea that was filed as part 21 of the petition under (e) of this section if 22 (i) the defendant fails to appear at a hearing on the order 23 to show cause; 24 (ii) the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 25 that the defendant no longer qualifies for diversion under the conditions 26 described in (b) of this section; or 27 (iii) the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 28 that the defendant failed to fulfill the terms of the diversion agreement; 29 (B) dismiss the charge with prejudice if the defendant has 30 complied with and performed all of the conditions of the defendant's diversion 31 agreement, except that the defendant owes $500 or less of the fees required, 01 and the defendant pays the balance of any fees owed before the hearing; 02 (2) may not terminate a diversion agreement for failure to pay 03 restitution if the defendant has otherwise complied with and performed all of the 04 conditions of the diversion agreement. 05 (u) If the court terminates the diversion agreement, the court may take into 06 account any time toward partial fulfillment of the diversion agreement by the 07 defendant at sentencing. 08 (v) After the conclusion of the defendant's diversion period, a defendant who 09 has complied with and satisfied the conditions of the diversion agreement may apply 10 by motion to the court for an order dismissing the charge with prejudice. 11 (w) If a defendant does not file a motion for dismissal within six months after 12 the conclusion of the defendant's diversion period, the court may enter an order 13 dismissing the charge with prejudice if the court finds that the defendant fully 14 complied with and performed the conditions of the diversion agreement. Before a 15 court enters an order dismissing the charge with prejudice, the court shall enter a 16 judgment for any remaining amount of restitution owed by the defendant. 17 (x) If a defendant is an active duty member of the military or is a member of 18 the military, the court shall allow the defendant's appearance by telephone or by other 19 means, if the defendant's military service authorizes the appearance. If the defendant's 20 military service prohibits the defendant's appearance by telephone or other means and 21 prohibits the defendant from aiding and assisting the attorney who would appear on 22 the defendant's behalf, the court shall stay a termination proceeding. 23 (y) Except as prohibited by federal law or regulation, every provider of a 24 screening interview and subsequent treatment programs to which persons are ordered 25 under this section shall supply the judge, prosecutor, defendant, and an agency 26 involved in the defendant's treatment with information and reports concerning the 27 defendant's past and present assessment, treatment, and progress. Information 28 compiled under this subsection is confidential and may only be used in connection 29 with court proceedings involving the defendant's treatment, including use by a court in 30 sentencing a person convicted under this section, or by an officer of the court in 31 preparing a presentence report for the use of the court in sentencing a person convicted 01 under this section. Monitoring of a defendant's progress under a diversion agreement 02 shall be the responsibility of the agency or organization that conducted the screening 03 interview. The agency or organization shall make a report to the court stating the 04 defendant's successful completion or failure to complete all or any part of the 05 treatment program specified by the screening interview. The form of the report shall 06 be determined by agreement between the court and the agency or organization 07 performing the screening interview. The court shall make the report of the agency or 08 organization performing the screening interview that is required by this subsection a 09 part of the record of the case. 10 Sec. 28.35.099.

The court shall sign the petition and indicate the date the 12 diversion period begins and ends and the date on which the driving while under the 13 influence offense occurred. A diversion agreement shall be for a period of one year 14 after the date the court grants the petition.

If the defendant has not already 17 been processed by the Department of Corrections or a municipal correctional facility 18 on the charge of driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, 19 or controlled substance under AS 28.35.030 or refusal to submit to a chemical test 20 under AS 28.35.032, the court shall require the defendant to submit to processing. 21 (k) The signed and dated petition is the diversion agreement between the 22 defendant and the court.

A statement by the defendant about the offense 30 made during the course of screening or a treatment program to a person employed by 31 the treatment program may not be offered or received as evidence in any criminal or 01 civil action or proceeding arising out of the conduct on which the charge of driving 02 while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, inhalant, or controlled substance 03 under AS 28.35.030, or the charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test under 04 AS 28.35.032, is based. 05 (m) The court may allow a defendant who is an active duty member of the 06 military to participate in a comparable treatment program conducted by or authorized 07 by a government entity in another jurisdiction to satisfy a treatment program 08 requirement as part of the defendant's diversion agreement. 09 (n) If a victim impact program exists in the community in which the defendant 10 resides, a court may order the defendant to attend a victim impact treatment session as 11 part of the defendant's diversion agreement.

Before a 15 court enters an order dismissing the charge with prejudice, the court shall enter a 16 judgment for any remaining amount of restitution owed by the defendant. 17 (x) If a defendant is an active duty member of the military or is a member of 18 the military, the court shall allow the defendant's appearance by telephone or by other 19 means, if the defendant's military service authorizes the appearance. If the defendant's 20 military service prohibits the defendant's appearance by telephone or other means and 21 prohibits the defendant from aiding and assisting the attorney who would appear on 22 the defendant's behalf, the court shall stay a termination proceeding. 23 (y) Except as prohibited by federal law or regulation, every provider of a 24 screening interview and subsequent treatment programs to which persons are ordered 25 under this section shall supply the judge, prosecutor, defendant, and an agency 26 involved in the defendant's treatment with information and reports concerning the 27 defendant's past and present assessment, treatment, and progress.

The agency or organization shall make a report to the court stating the 04 defendant's successful completion or failure to complete all or any part of the 05 treatment program specified by the screening interview. The form of the report shall 06 be determined by agreement between the court and the agency or organization 07 performing the screening interview.
