AS 14.03.260(a) is amended to read: 05 (a) A local school board shall provide an approved charter school with an 06 annual program budget. The budget shall be not less than the amount generated by the 07 students enrolled in the charter school less administrative costs retained by the local 08 school district, determined by applying the indirect cost rate approved by the 09 department up to four percent. Costs directly related to charter school facilities, 10 including rent, utilities, and maintenance, may not be included in an annual program 11 budget for the purposes of calculating the four percent cap on administrative costs 12 under this subsection. A local school board shall provide a charter school with a report 13 itemizing the administrative costs retained by the local school board under this section. 14 The "amount generated by students enrolled in the charter school" is to be determined 01 in the same manner as it would be for a student enrolled in another public school in 02 that school district and includes funds generated by grants, appropriations, federal 03 impact aid, [THE REQUIRED LOCAL CONTRIBUTION,] the local contribution 04 under AS 14.17.410(c), special needs under AS 14.17.420(a)(1), and secondary school 05 vocational and technical instruction under AS 14.17.420(a)(3). A school district shall 06 direct state aid under AS 14.11 for the construction or major maintenance of a charter 07 school facility to the charter school that generated the state aid, subject to the same 08 terms and conditions that apply to state aid under AS 14.11 for construction or major 09 maintenance of a school facility that is not a charter school. 10 * Sec. 2. AS 14.12.020(c) is amended to read: 11 (c) The legislature shall provide the state money necessary to maintain and 12 operate districts of the state public school system described in AS 14.12.010 [THE 13 REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL ATTENDANCE AREAS]. The borough assembly for 14 a borough school district, and the city council for a city school district, may [SHALL] 15 provide [THE] money for a local contribution under AS 14.17.410(c) [THAT 16 MUST BE RAISED] from local sources to maintain and operate the district. 17 * Sec. 3. AS 14.17.410(b) is amended to read: 18 (b) Public school funding consists of state aid, a [REQUIRED] local 19 contribution under (c) of this section, and eligible federal impact aid. State 20 [DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS: 21 (1) STATE] aid equals basic need minus [A REQUIRED LOCAL 22 CONTRIBUTION AND] 90 percent of eligible federal impact aid for that fiscal year. 23 Basic [; BASIC] need equals the sum obtained under (4) [(D)] of this subsection 24 [PARAGRAPH], multiplied by the base student allocation set out in AS 14.17.470. 25 The [;] district adjusted ADM is calculated as follows: 26 (1) [(A)] the ADM of each school in the district is calculated by 27 applying the school size factor to the student count as set out in AS 14.17.450; 28 (2) [(B)] the number obtained under (1) [(A)] of this subsection 29 [PARAGRAPH] is multiplied by the district cost factor described in AS 14.17.460; 30 (3) [(C)] the ADMs of each school in a district, as adjusted according 31 to (1) and (2) [(A) AND (B)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH], are added; the sum 01 is then multiplied by the special needs factor set out in AS 14.17.420(a)(1) and the 02 secondary school vocational and technical instruction funding factor set out in 03 AS 14.17.420(a)(3); 04 (4) [(D)] the number obtained for intensive services under 05 AS 14.17.420(a)(2) and the number obtained for correspondence study under 06 AS 14.17.430 are added to the number obtained under (3) [(C)] of this subsection 07 [PARAGRAPH] or under (8) and (9) [(H) AND (I)] of this subsection 08 [PARAGRAPH]; 09 (5) [(E)] notwithstanding (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection 10 [PARAGRAPH], if a school district's ADM adjusted for school size under (1) [(A)] of 11 this subsection [PARAGRAPH] decreases by five percent or more from one fiscal 12 year to the next fiscal year, the school district may use the last fiscal year before the 13 decrease as a base fiscal year to offset the decrease, according to the following 14 method: 15 (A) [(i)] for the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year 16 determined under this paragraph [SUBPARAGRAPH], the school district's 17 ADM adjusted for school size determined under (1) [(A)] of this subsection 18 [PARAGRAPH] is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, 19 plus 75 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size 20 between the base fiscal year and the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 21 (B) [(ii)] for the second fiscal year after the base fiscal year 22 determined under this paragraph [SUBPARAGRAPH], the school district's 23 ADM adjusted for school size determined under (1) [(A)] of this subsection 24 [PARAGRAPH] is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, 25 plus 50 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size 26 between the base fiscal year and the second fiscal year after the base fiscal 27 year; 28 (C) [(iii)] for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year 29 determined under this paragraph [SUBPARAGRAPH], the school district's 30 ADM adjusted for school size determined under (1) [(A)] of this subsection 31 [PARAGRAPH] is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, 01 plus 25 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size 02 between the base fiscal year and the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 03 (6) [(F)] the method established in (5) [(E)] of this subsection 04 [PARAGRAPH] is available to a school district for the three fiscal years following the 05 base fiscal year determined under (5) [(E)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] only if 06 the district's ADM adjusted for school size determined under (1) [(A)] of this 07 subsection [PARAGRAPH] for each fiscal year is less than the district's ADM 08 adjusted for school size in the base fiscal year; 09 (7) [(G)] the method established in (5) [(E)] of this subsection 10 [PARAGRAPH] does not apply to a decrease in the district's ADM adjusted for school 11 size resulting from a loss of enrollment that occurs as a result of a boundary change 12 under AS 29; 13 (8) [(H)] notwithstanding (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection 14 [PARAGRAPH], if one or more schools close and consolidate with one or more other 15 schools in the same community and district and, as a result of the consolidation, basic 16 need generated by the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) 17 - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] decreases, the district may use the 18 last fiscal year before the consolidation as the base fiscal year to offset that decrease 19 for the first four fiscal years following consolidation according to the following 20 method: 21 (A) [(i)] for the first two fiscal years after the base fiscal year, 22 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 23 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] is calculated by dividing the sum of 24 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 25 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for the base fiscal year by the sum of 26 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without 27 adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the district's 28 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under 29 (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] by the sum of the 30 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without 31 adjustment, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 01 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, and adding 02 that number to the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for 03 the current fiscal year as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection 04 [PARAGRAPH]; 05 (B) [(ii)] for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the 06 district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 07 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] is calculated by dividing the sum of 08 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 09 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for the base fiscal year by the sum of 10 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without 11 adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 12 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 13 adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] by the 14 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal 15 year, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 16 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, multiplying 17 that number by 66 percent, and adding that number to the sum of the district's 18 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under 19 (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH]; 20 (C) [(iii)] for the fourth fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the 21 district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 22 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] is calculated by dividing the sum of 23 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 24 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for the base fiscal year by the sum of 25 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without 26 adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 27 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 28 adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] by the 29 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal 30 year, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 31 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, multiplying 01 that number by 33 percent, and adding that number to the sum of the district's 02 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under 03 (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH]; 04 (D) [(iv)] to calculate the district's basic need for each fiscal 05 year, the number obtained through the calculation in (A), (B), or (C) [(i), (ii), 06 OR (iii)] of this paragraph [SUBPARAGRAPH] is added to the number 07 obtained under (3) [(C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for the remainder 08 of the district; 09 (9) [(I)] if the basic need calculated under (8)(A) - (C) [(H)(i) - (iii)] of 10 this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for one of the first four fiscal years after 11 consolidation is less than the basic need calculated under (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this 12 subsection [PARAGRAPH] for that fiscal year, the basic need may not be adjusted 13 under (8) [(H)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for that fiscal year; 14 (10) [(J)] a district may not offset a decrease under (8) [(H)] of this 15 subsection [PARAGRAPH] if 16 (A) [(i)] a new facility is constructed in the district for the 17 consolidation; or 18 (B) [(ii)] the district offset a decrease under (5) [(E)] of this 19 subsection [PARAGRAPH] in the same fiscal year; 20 (11) [(K)] a district that offsets a decrease under (8) [(H)] of this 21 subsection [PARAGRAPH] may not reopen a school that was closed for 22 consolidation in the district until 23 (A) [(i)] seven or more years have passed since the school 24 closure; and 25 (B) [(ii)] the district provides evidence satisfactory to the 26 department that the schools affected by the consolidation are over capacity; 27 (12) [(L)] a district may not reopen and reconsolidate a school that was 28 consolidated in the district more than once every seven years for purposes of the 29 calculations made under (8) [(H)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH]; 30 (13) [(M)] a district offsetting a decrease under (8) [(H)] of this 31 subsection [PARAGRAPH] shall provide the department with the list of schools 01 participating in the consolidation and the corresponding ADM [;

AS 14.03.260(a) is amended to read: 05 (a) A local school board shall provide an approved charter school with an 06 annual program budget. The budget shall be not less than the amount generated by the 07 students enrolled in the charter school less administrative costs retained by the local 08 school district, determined by applying the indirect cost rate approved by the 09 department up to four percent. Costs directly related to charter school facilities, 10 including rent, utilities, and maintenance, may not be included in an annual program 11 budget for the purposes of calculating the four percent cap on administrative costs 12 under this subsection. A local school board shall provide a charter school with a report 13 itemizing the administrative costs retained by the local school board under this section. 14 The "amount generated by students enrolled in the charter school" is to be determined 01 in the same manner as it would be for a student enrolled in another public school in 02 that school district and includes funds generated by grants, appropriations, federal 03 impact aid, [THE REQUIRED LOCAL CONTRIBUTION,] the local contribution 04 under AS 14.17.410(c), special needs under AS 14.17.420(a)(1), and secondary school 05 vocational and technical instruction under AS 14.17.420(a)(3). A school district shall 06 direct state aid under AS 14.11 for the construction or major maintenance of a charter 07 school facility to the charter school that generated the state aid, subject to the same 08 terms and conditions that apply to state aid under AS 14.11 for construction or major 09 maintenance of a school facility that is not a charter school. 10 * Sec. 2. AS 14.12.020(c) is amended to read: 11 (c) The legislature shall provide the state money necessary to maintain and 12 operate districts of the state public school system described in AS 14.12.010 [THE 13 REGIONAL EDUCATIONAL ATTENDANCE AREAS]. The borough assembly for 14 a borough school district, and the city council for a city school district, may [SHALL] 15 provide [THE] money for a local contribution under AS 14.17.410(c) [THAT 16 MUST BE RAISED] from local sources to maintain and operate the district. 17 * Sec. 3. AS 14.17.410(b) is amended to read: 18 (b) Public school funding consists of state aid, a [REQUIRED] local 19 contribution under (c) of this section, and eligible federal impact aid. State 20 [DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS: 21 (1) STATE] aid equals basic need minus [A REQUIRED LOCAL 22 CONTRIBUTION AND] 90 percent of eligible federal impact aid for that fiscal year. 23 Basic [; BASIC] need equals the sum obtained under (4) [(D)] of this subsection 24 [PARAGRAPH], multiplied by the base student allocation set out in AS 14.17.470. 25 The [;] district adjusted ADM is calculated as follows: 26 (1) [(A)] the ADM of each school in the district is calculated by 27 applying the school size factor to the student count as set out in AS 14.17.450; 28 (2) [(B)] the number obtained under (1) [(A)] of this subsection 29 [PARAGRAPH] is multiplied by the district cost factor described in AS 14.17.460; 30 (3) [(C)] the ADMs of each school in a district, as adjusted according 31 to (1) and (2) [(A) AND (B)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH], are added; the sum 01 is then multiplied by the special needs factor set out in AS 14.17.420(a)(1) and the 02 secondary school vocational and technical instruction funding factor set out in 03 AS 14.17.420(a)(3); 04 (4) [(D)] the number obtained for intensive services under 05 AS 14.17.420(a)(2) and the number obtained for correspondence study under 06 AS 14.17.430 are added to the number obtained under (3) [(C)] of this subsection 07 [PARAGRAPH] or under (8) and (9) [(H) AND (I)] of this subsection 08 [PARAGRAPH]; 09 (5) [(E)] notwithstanding (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection 10 [PARAGRAPH], if a school district's ADM adjusted for school size under (1) [(A)] of 11 this subsection [PARAGRAPH] decreases by five percent or more from one fiscal 12 year to the next fiscal year, the school district may use the last fiscal year before the 13 decrease as a base fiscal year to offset the decrease, according to the following 14 method: 15 (A) [(i)] for the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year 16 determined under this paragraph [SUBPARAGRAPH], the school district's 17 ADM adjusted for school size determined under (1) [(A)] of this subsection 18 [PARAGRAPH] is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, 19 plus 75 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size 20 between the base fiscal year and the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 21 (B) [(ii)] for the second fiscal year after the base fiscal year 22 determined under this paragraph [SUBPARAGRAPH], the school district's 23 ADM adjusted for school size determined under (1) [(A)] of this subsection 24 [PARAGRAPH] is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, 25 plus 50 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size 26 between the base fiscal year and the second fiscal year after the base fiscal 27 year; 28 (C) [(iii)] for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year 29 determined under this paragraph [SUBPARAGRAPH], the school district's 30 ADM adjusted for school size determined under (1) [(A)] of this subsection 31 [PARAGRAPH] is calculated as the district's ADM adjusted for school size, 01 plus 25 percent of the difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size 02 between the base fiscal year and the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 03 (6) [(F)] the method established in (5) [(E)] of this subsection 04 [PARAGRAPH] is available to a school district for the three fiscal years following the 05 base fiscal year determined under (5) [(E)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] only if 06 the district's ADM adjusted for school size determined under (1) [(A)] of this 07 subsection [PARAGRAPH] for each fiscal year is less than the district's ADM 08 adjusted for school size in the base fiscal year; 09 (7) [(G)] the method established in (5) [(E)] of this subsection 10 [PARAGRAPH] does not apply to a decrease in the district's ADM adjusted for school 11 size resulting from a loss of enrollment that occurs as a result of a boundary change 12 under AS 29; 13 (8) [(H)] notwithstanding (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection 14 [PARAGRAPH], if one or more schools close and consolidate with one or more other 15 schools in the same community and district and, as a result of the consolidation, basic 16 need generated by the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) 17 - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] decreases, the district may use the 18 last fiscal year before the consolidation as the base fiscal year to offset that decrease 19 for the first four fiscal years following consolidation according to the following 20 method: 21 (A) [(i)] for the first two fiscal years after the base fiscal year, 22 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 23 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] is calculated by dividing the sum of 24 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 25 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for the base fiscal year by the sum of 26 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without 27 adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the district's 28 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under 29 (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] by the sum of the 30 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without 31 adjustment, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 01 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, and adding 02 that number to the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for 03 the current fiscal year as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection 04 [PARAGRAPH]; 05 (B) [(ii)] for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the 06 district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 07 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] is calculated by dividing the sum of 08 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 09 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for the base fiscal year by the sum of 10 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without 11 adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 12 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 13 adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] by the 14 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal 15 year, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 16 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, multiplying 17 that number by 66 percent, and adding that number to the sum of the district's 18 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under 19 (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH]; 20 (C) [(iii)] for the fourth fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the 21 district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 22 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] is calculated by dividing the sum of 23 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - 24 (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for the base fiscal year by the sum of 25 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without 26 adjustment, and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 27 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 28 adjusted under (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] by the 29 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal 30 year, multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 31 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, multiplying 01 that number by 33 percent, and adding that number to the sum of the district's 02 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under 03 (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH]; 04 (D) [(iv)] to calculate the district's basic need for each fiscal 05 year, the number obtained through the calculation in (A), (B), or (C) [(i), (ii), 06 OR (iii)] of this paragraph [SUBPARAGRAPH] is added to the number 07 obtained under (3) [(C)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for the remainder 08 of the district; 09 (9) [(I)] if the basic need calculated under (8)(A) - (C) [(H)(i) - (iii)] of 10 this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for one of the first four fiscal years after 11 consolidation is less than the basic need calculated under (1) - (3) [(A) - (C)] of this 12 subsection [PARAGRAPH] for that fiscal year, the basic need may not be adjusted 13 under (8) [(H)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH] for that fiscal year; 14 (10) [(J)] a district may not offset a decrease under (8) [(H)] of this 15 subsection [PARAGRAPH] if 16 (A) [(i)] a new facility is constructed in the district for the 17 consolidation; or 18 (B) [(ii)] the district offset a decrease under (5) [(E)] of this 19 subsection [PARAGRAPH] in the same fiscal year; 20 (11) [(K)] a district that offsets a decrease under (8) [(H)] of this 21 subsection [PARAGRAPH] may not reopen a school that was closed for 22 consolidation in the district until 23 (A) [(i)] seven or more years have passed since the school 24 closure; and 25 (B) [(ii)] the district provides evidence satisfactory to the 26 department that the schools affected by the consolidation are over capacity; 27 (12) [(L)] a district may not reopen and reconsolidate a school that was 28 consolidated in the district more than once every seven years for purposes of the 29 calculations made under (8) [(H)] of this subsection [PARAGRAPH]; 30 (13) [(M)] a district offsetting a decrease under (8) [(H)] of this 31 subsection [PARAGRAPH] shall provide the department with the list of schools 01 participating in the consolidation and the corresponding ADM [;
