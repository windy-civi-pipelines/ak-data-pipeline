The commission may apply to any court having power to issue compulsory                                               <span class=unselectable>11</span> process for orders in aid of its powers and responsibilities pursuant to this Article and                               <span class=unselectable>12</span> any and all such courts shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. Failure of any                                    <span class=unselectable>13</span> person to obey any such order shall be punishable as contempt of the issuing court. If                                  <span class=unselectable>14</span> the party or subject matter on account of which the commission seeks an order is                                        <span class=unselectable>15</span> within the jurisdiction of the court to which application is made, such application may                                 <span class=unselectable>16</span> be to a court in the state or subdivision on behalf of which the audit is being made or a                               <span class=unselectable>17</span> court in the state in which the object of the order being sought is situated. The                                       <span class=unselectable>18</span> provisions of this paragraph apply only to courts in a state that has adopted this                                      <span class=unselectable>19</span>       Article.                                                                                                          <span class=unselectable>20</span> 5. The commission may decline to perform any audit requested if it finds that                                           <span class=unselectable>21</span> its available personnel or other resources are insufficient for the purpose or that, in the                             <span class=unselectable>22</span> terms requested, the audit is impracticable of satisfactory performance. If the                                         <span class=unselectable>23</span> commission, on the basis of its experience, has reason to believe that an audit of a                                    <span class=unselectable>24</span> particular taxpayer, either at a particular time or on a particular schedule, would be of                               <span class=unselectable>25</span> interest to a number of party states or their subdivisions, it may offer to make the audit                              <span class=unselectable>26</span> or audits, the offer to be contingent on sufficient participation therein as determined by                              <span class=unselectable>27</span>       the commission.                                                                                                   <span class=unselectable>28</span> 6.
