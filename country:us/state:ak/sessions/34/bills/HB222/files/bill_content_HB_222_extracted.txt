(a) An 17 employer may file a petition in the district or superior court for a protective order 18 against an individual who the employer reasonably believes 19 (1) committed an act of violence against the employer or an employee 20 that occurred at the employer's workplace; or 21 (2) made a threat of violence against the employer or an employee that 22 can reasonably be construed as a threat that may be carried out at the employer's 23 workplace. 24 (b) When a petition for a protective order is filed, the court shall schedule a 25 hearing and provide at least 10 days' notice to the respondent of the hearing and of the 26 respondent's right to appear and be heard, either in person or through an attorney. If 27 the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that the respondent has committed 28 violence or made a threat of violence, regardless of whether the respondent appears at 29 the hearing, the court may order any relief available under (c) of this section. The 30 provisions of a protective order issued under this section are effective for six months 31 unless earlier dissolved by the court. 01 (c) A protective order issued under this section may 02 (1) prohibit the respondent from making a threat to commit or 03 committing violence; 04 (2) prohibit the respondent from telephoning, contacting, or otherwise 05 communicating directly or indirectly with the petitioner; 06 (3) direct the respondent to stay away from the workplace of the 07 petitioner, or space adjacent to the workplace of the petitioner, or any specified place 08 frequented by the petitioner, during the normal course of the petitioner's business; 09 however, the court may order the respondent to stay away from the respondent's own 10 workplace only if the respondent has been provided actual notice of the opportunity to 11 appear and be heard on the petition; 12 (4) order other relief the court determines to be necessary to protect the 13 workplace of the petitioner. 14 (d) If the court issues a protective order under this section, the court shall 15 (1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by 16 the petitioner and the respondent; and 17 (2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement 18 agency for expedited service and entry into the central registry of protective orders 19 under AS 18.65.540. 20 (e) A court may not deny a petition for a protective order solely because of a 21 lapse of time between an act of violence or a threat of violence and the filing of the 22 petition. 23 Sec. 18.65.877. Ex parte protective orders for workplace violence. An 24 employer who may file a petition for a protective order against an individual under 25 AS 18.65.875 may file a petition for an ex parte protective order against the 26 individual. If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that recent 27 violence has occurred or a recent threat of violence has been made, that it is necessary 28 to protect the employer from further violence, and that the petitioner has certified to 29 the court in writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide notice to the 30 respondent, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a 31 protective order. An ex parte protective order under this section may grant the 01 protection allowed by AS 18.65.875(c). An ex parte protective order expires 20 days 02 after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of either the 03 petitioner or the respondent after notice and, if requested, a hearing.

A petitioner is not barred from 16 seeking an order under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899 because of the existence of another 17 civil action between the petitioner and the respondent. 18 Sec. 18.65.890.

(a) An 17 employer may file a petition in the district or superior court for a protective order 18 against an individual who the employer reasonably believes 19 (1) committed an act of violence against the employer or an employee 20 that occurred at the employer's workplace; or 21 (2) made a threat of violence against the employer or an employee that 22 can reasonably be construed as a threat that may be carried out at the employer's 23 workplace. 24 (b) When a petition for a protective order is filed, the court shall schedule a 25 hearing and provide at least 10 days' notice to the respondent of the hearing and of the 26 respondent's right to appear and be heard, either in person or through an attorney. If 27 the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that the respondent has committed 28 violence or made a threat of violence, regardless of whether the respondent appears at 29 the hearing, the court may order any relief available under (c) of this section. The 30 provisions of a protective order issued under this section are effective for six months 31 unless earlier dissolved by the court. 01 (c) A protective order issued under this section may 02 (1) prohibit the respondent from making a threat to commit or 03 committing violence; 04 (2) prohibit the respondent from telephoning, contacting, or otherwise 05 communicating directly or indirectly with the petitioner; 06 (3) direct the respondent to stay away from the workplace of the 07 petitioner, or space adjacent to the workplace of the petitioner, or any specified place 08 frequented by the petitioner, during the normal course of the petitioner's business; 09 however, the court may order the respondent to stay away from the respondent's own 10 workplace only if the respondent has been provided actual notice of the opportunity to 11 appear and be heard on the petition; 12 (4) order other relief the court determines to be necessary to protect the 13 workplace of the petitioner. 14 (d) If the court issues a protective order under this section, the court shall 15 (1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by 16 the petitioner and the respondent; and 17 (2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement 18 agency for expedited service and entry into the central registry of protective orders 19 under AS 18.65.540. 20 (e) A court may not deny a petition for a protective order solely because of a 21 lapse of time between an act of violence or a threat of violence and the filing of the 22 petition. 23 Sec. 18.65.877. Ex parte protective orders for workplace violence. An 24 employer who may file a petition for a protective order against an individual under 25 AS 18.65.875 may file a petition for an ex parte protective order against the 26 individual. If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that recent 27 violence has occurred or a recent threat of violence has been made, that it is necessary 28 to protect the employer from further violence, and that the petitioner has certified to 29 the court in writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide notice to the 30 respondent, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a 31 protective order. An ex parte protective order under this section may grant the 01 protection allowed by AS 18.65.875(c). An ex parte protective order expires 20 days 02 after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of either the 03 petitioner or the respondent after notice and, if requested, a hearing. If the court issues 04 an ex parte protective order, the court shall have the order delivered to the appropriate 05 law enforcement agency for expedited service and entry into the central registry of 06 protective orders under AS 18.65.540. 07 Sec. 18.65.880. Modification of workplace violence protective order. (a) 08 Either the petitioner or the respondent may request modification of a protective order 09 issued under AS 18.65.875 or 18.65.877. If a request is made for modification of 10 (1) a protective order after notice and hearing under AS 18.65.875, the 11 court shall schedule a hearing within 20 days after the date the request is made, except 12 that if the court finds that the request is meritless on its face, the court may deny the 13 request without further hearing; or 14 (2) an ex parte protective order under AS 18.65.877, the court shall 15 schedule a hearing on three days' notice or on shorter notice as the court may 16 prescribe. 17 (b) If a request for a modification is made under this section and the 18 respondent raises an issue not raised by the petitioner, the court may allow the 19 petitioner additional time to respond. 20 (c) If the court modifies a protective order under this section, the court shall 21 issue a modified order and shall 22 (1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by 23 the petitioner and the respondent; and 24 (2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement 25 agency for expedited service and for entry into the central registry of protective orders 26 under AS 18.65.540. 27 Sec. 18.65.885. Specific protective orders. (a) If a respondent in a protective 28 order issued under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.880 is prohibited from communicating with 29 the petitioner, excluded from the petitioner's workplace or space adjacent to the 30 petitioner's workplace, or ordered to stay away from the petitioner as provided in 31 AS 18.65.875(c)(2) - (4), an invitation by the petitioner to communicate, enter the 01 petitioner's workplace, or have other prohibited contact with the petitioner does not 02 waive or nullify any provision in a protective order. 03 (b) A court may not order parties into mediation or refer them to mediation for 04 resolution of the issues arising from a petition for a protective order under 05 AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899. 06 (c) In addition to other required information contained in a protective order, 07 the order must include in boldface type the following statements: 08 (1) "Violation of this order may be a misdemeanor, punishable by up 09 to one year of incarceration and up to a $25,000 fine"; 10 (2) "If you are ordered to have no contact with the petitioner or to stay 11 away from the petitioner's workplace or other place designated by the court, an 12 invitation by the petitioner to have the prohibited contact or to be present at or enter 13 the workplace or other place does not in any way invalidate or nullify the order." 14 (d) A protective order issued under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899 is in addition to 15 and not in place of any other civil or criminal remedy. A petitioner is not barred from 16 seeking an order under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899 because of the existence of another 17 civil action between the petitioner and the respondent. 18 Sec. 18.65.890. Forms for petitions and orders; fees. (a) The Alaska Court 19 System shall prepare forms for petitions, protective orders, and instructions for their 20 use by an employer seeking a protective order under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899.

While a protective order is in effect or a petition for a protective 26 order is pending, both the petitioner and the respondent have a continuing duty to 27 inform the court of pending civil or criminal actions involving the petitioner or the 28 respondent. 29 (c) The office of the clerk of each superior and district court shall make 30 available to the public the forms a person seeking a protective order under 31 AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899 may need and instructions for the use of the forms. The 01 clerk shall provide assistance in completing the forms and filing the forms. 02 (d) Filing fees may not be charged in any action seeking only the relief 03 provided in AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899. 04 (e) Attorney fees may not be awarded against a petitioner seeking a protective 05 order under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899. 06 Sec. 18.65.895. Service of process. (a) Unless, on the record in court, the 07 respondent has already been provided a copy of the court's order, process issued under 08 AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899 shall be promptly served and executed. If process is to be 09 served on a respondent believed to be present or residing in a municipality, as defined 10 in AS 29.71.800, or in an unincorporated community, process shall be served by a 11 peace officer of that municipality or unincorporated community who has jurisdiction 12 within the area of service. If a peace officer of the municipality or unincorporated 13 community who has jurisdiction is not available, a superior court, district court, or 14 magistrate may designate any other peace officer to serve and execute process. A state 15 peace officer shall serve process in any area that is not within the jurisdiction of a 16 peace officer of a municipality or unincorporated community. A peace officer shall 17 use every reasonable means to serve process issued under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899. 18 A judge may not order a peace officer to serve a petition that has been denied by the 19 court. 20 (b) Service of process under (a) of this section does not preclude a petitioner 21 from using any other available means to serve process issued under AS 18.65.875 - 22 18.65.899. 23 (c) Fees for service of process may not be charged in a proceeding seeking 24 only the relief provided in AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899. 25 Sec. 18.65.897.
