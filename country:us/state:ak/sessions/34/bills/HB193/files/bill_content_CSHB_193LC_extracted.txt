Qualifying purpose. An eligible employee may use paid 20 parental leave when the employee needs to be absent from work to 21 (1) care for a child within 12 months of the 22 (A) anticipated birth of that child to, adoption of that child by, 23 or placement of that child with the eligible employee; or 24 (B) appointment of the eligible employee as the legal guardian 25 of that child; or 26 (2) complete an adoption, legal guardianship, or foster placement 27 process of a child before the child is adopted by or placed with the employee. 28 Sec. 23.10.720. Paid parental leave claim. (a) The department shall establish 29 by regulation procedures for filing a claim for paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 30 - 23.10.795, including a procedure for certifying that the leave is for a qualifying 31 purpose under AS 23.10.715. 01 (b) An employee may file a claim with the department for paid parental leave 02 not more than 60 days before the anticipated start date of the qualifying absence from 03 work nor more than 90 days after the date on which the qualifying absence from work 04 began. The department may waive the 90-day filing deadline for good cause. The 05 department may process a claim without the eligible employee providing exact dates 06 of an anticipated qualifying absence from work. The department may adjust claim data 07 through a claim modification process established by the department. 08 (c) The department may accept any of the following as sufficient evidence that 09 a paid parental leave claim is for a qualifying purpose: 10 (1) the child's birth certificate; 11 (2) a document from the child's health care provider or the health care 12 provider of the person who gave birth to the child, stating the child's date of birth; 13 (3) a document from the child's health care provider, the adoption 14 agency involved in the adoption, or another individual approved by the department 15 confirming the adoption or anticipated adoption and the date of the adoption or 16 anticipated adoption; 17 (4) a document from the foster care agency involved in the child's 18 placement, or from another individual approved by the department, confirming the 19 placement or anticipated placement of the child for foster care; 20 (5) a form signed by the employee acknowledging paternity of the 21 child that meets the requirements of AS 18.50.165; or 22 (6) a document from a state or tribal court confirming a petition for or 23 decree of legal guardianship of the child. 24 Sec. 23.10.725. Eligibility; benefit amount; duration. (a) An employee who 25 is paid at least $2,500 in wages during at least two of the calendar quarters of the 26 employee's base period is eligible to receive paid parental leave beginning the first day 27 of absence from work for a qualifying purpose under AS 23.10.715. 28 (b) The department shall calculate an employee's base period for purposes of 29 (a) of this section using the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters 30 immediately preceding the first day of the employee's benefit year, except that, if an 31 employee would not otherwise be eligible for paid parental leave because of the use of 01 a base period that does not include the most recently completed calendar quarter 02 immediately preceding the first day of the employee's benefit year, the department 03 shall calculate the employee's base period and determine the employee's eligibility 04 using the four most recently completed calendar quarters before the start of the benefit 05 year. For an individual who has been separated from employment for not more than 26 06 weeks, the department shall calculate the individual's base period using the first four 07 of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's 08 separation from employment, except that, if an individual would not otherwise be 09 eligible for paid parental leave because of the use of a base period that does not 10 include the most recently completed calendar quarter, the department shall calculate 11 the individual's base period and determine the individual's eligibility using the four 12 most recently completed calendar quarters before the start of the benefit year. 13 (c) The department shall determine an eligible employee's weekly benefit in 14 the same manner as provided in AS 23.20.350(d). The department shall calculate the 15 employee's weekly benefit in accordance with AS 23.10.730 for employees using the 16 accelerated benefit option. 17 (d) The maximum number of weeks for which an eligible employee may take 18 paid parental leave, and for which paid parental leave insurance benefits are payable in 19 a benefit year, is between eight and 26 weeks, cumulative, as determined by the 20 department. The department shall determine and make public the maximum duration 21 of the parental leave benefit each year, based on fund solvency, forecasted use, and 22 actuarial studies completed under AS 23.10.780. For employees using the accelerated 23 benefit option, the department shall calculate the number of weeks an eligible 24 employee may take paid parental leave in accordance with AS 23.10.730. 25 (e) In this section, "benefit year" means a period of 52 consecutive weeks 26 beginning at 12:00 a.m. of the Sunday preceding the day that an eligible employee 27 first files a claim for paid parental leave and, thereafter, the period of 52 consecutive 28 weeks beginning at 12:00 a.m. of the Sunday preceding the day that the insured 29 worker next files the claim after the end of the eligible employee's last preceding 30 benefit year; however, for an eligible employee covered by this subsection, "benefit 31 year" also means a period of 53 weeks if the filing of a claim for paid parental leave 01 would result in overlapping any quarter of the base year of a previously filed request 02 for paid parental leave. 03 Sec. 23.10.730. Accelerated benefit option. An eligible employee may choose 04 to receive the paid parental leave benefit on an accelerated basis. For each week the 05 employee elects the accelerated benefit option, the employee shall receive double the 06 weekly benefit amount to which the employee is entitled. However, for each week the 07 employee chooses the accelerated benefit option, the duration of the benefit is reduced 08 by a corresponding week. 09 Sec. 23.10.735. Coordination of benefits. (a) Leave taken under the paid 10 parental leave program shall run concurrently with leave that also qualifies as leave 11 under 29 U.S.C. 2601 - 2654 (Family and Medical Leave Act) or AS 39.20.500 - 12 39.20.550. 13 (b) An employer may require that payments for paid parental leave under 14 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 be made concurrently with, or coordinated with, payments 15 or leave provided under a short-term disability policy or a separate bank of paid time 16 off designated specifically for parental leave under a collective bargaining agreement 17 or employer policy. The employer must provide employees written notice of this 18 requirement. 19 (c) An employee may not be required to use or exhaust any accrued vacation 20 leave, sick leave, or other paid time off before or while receiving paid parental leave 21 benefits under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. However, the employee may choose to use 22 accrued vacation leave, sick leave, or other paid time off while receiving paid parental 23 leave benefits under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 if the total amount received does not 24 exceed the employee's average weekly earnings. 25 (d) Paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 does not relieve an 26 employer from the obligation to comply with more generous terms included in a 27 collective bargaining agreement or employment contract. 28 Sec. 23.10.740. Disqualification. In addition to any other penalty that may 29 apply, an employee may be disqualified from paid parental leave benefits for up to one 30 year if the department determines the employee intentionally made a false statement or 31 misrepresentation of a material fact, or intentionally failed to report a material fact, to 01 obtain paid parental leave. 02 Sec. 23.10.745. Appeals. The department shall establish a process for an 03 employee to appeal a determination by the department regarding a paid parental leave 04 claim within 90 days after receiving notice of the determination. 05 Sec. 23.10.750. Recovery of improper payments. (a) An employee who 06 receives paid parental leave to which the employee is not entitled under AS 23.10.700 07 - 23.10.795 shall repay to the department the amount improperly paid. The department 08 shall deposit the payment in the parental leave fund account established in 09 AS 23.10.705. 10 (b) The department shall promptly prepare and send a notice of determination 11 to the employee at the employee's last address of record, stating that the employee is 12 required to repay the amount of paid parental leave received in error. If the employee 13 does not repay the amount received in error within a reasonable time set by the 14 department, the department shall deduct the amount from future paid parental leave 15 benefits owed to the employee or from the permanent fund dividend of the employee 16 under AS 43.23.140(b)(6). However, the department may waive repayment of all or a 17 portion of the amount of paid parental leave received in error if the department 18 determines that the employee has died or has acted in good faith when claiming and 19 receiving paid parental leave benefits and that requiring repayment would be unfair or 20 inequitable. 21 (c) If the employee has not repaid the paid parental leave benefit or if the 22 amount has not been deducted from future benefits or the permanent fund dividend of 23 the employee within two years after the last day of the year in which payment was 24 made, the commissioner may declare the amount uncollectible. 25 Sec. 23.10.755. Public education and outreach campaign. The department 26 shall conduct a public education and outreach campaign to educate employees and 27 employers about the availability of paid parental leave. 28 Sec. 23.10.760. Employment protection; health insurance maintenance; 29 enforcement. (a) An eligible employee who takes paid parental leave under 30 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 is entitled to return to the position the employee held when 31 the leave began or to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent seniority, 01 pay, benefits, working hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, 02 including service credits the employee was entitled to at the start of paid parental 03 leave. 04 (b) During any period of qualified paid parental leave, the employer shall 05 maintain the employee's health care benefits on the same terms as before the leave 06 began. The employee shall continue to pay the employee's share of the cost of any 07 health care benefits. 08 (c) An employer may not take or threaten any adverse employment action or 09 discriminate against the employee for applying for or using paid parental leave under 10 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. 11 (d) An employer may not take any action that prevents or discourages an 12 employee from taking paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795, including 13 failing to provide timely and complete information required by the department or 14 reporting or threatening to report suspected citizenship or immigration status of the 15 employee or an employee's family member. 16 (e) An employer may not adopt or enforce a policy that allows paid parental 17 leave taken under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 to be considered as an absence that could 18 result in discipline, discharge, demotion, suspension, or any other adverse action 19 against the employee. 20 (f) The department shall establish a complaint process by regulation for an 21 employee who believes the employee's employer violated this section. A complaint 22 must be filed within two years after the violation occurred or the date the employee 23 reasonably should have known about the violation, whichever is later. 24 (g) After granting the employer a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, or 25 after the employer acknowledges that a violation occurred, the department may 26 determine whether a violation occurred. If the department determines a violation 27 occurred, the department may order the employer to remedy the violation, which may 28 include 29 (1) granting the requested paid parental leave; 30 (2) providing up to two years of back pay, plus interest; 31 (3) reinstating the employee; 01 (4) paying to the complainant attorney fees allowed under the Alaska 02 Rules of Civil Procedure; 03 (5) other relief the department considers appropriate. 04 (h) After the department issues a final determination, either party may appeal 05 the determination to a court of competent jurisdiction. 06 Sec. 23.10.765. Notice to employees. (a) An employer shall provide written 07 notice to each employee upon hiring, and annually thereafter, of the benefits available 08 under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795.

Child support interception. (a) Notwithstanding any other 22 provision of AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795, an individual filing a new claim for paid 23 parental leave must disclose whether child support obligations are owed by that 24 individual. If the individual discloses that child support obligations are owed and the 25 individual is determined to be eligible for paid parental leave, the department shall 26 notify the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue that the 27 individual has been determined to be eligible for paid parental leave. 28 (b) The department shall, unless the obligor and obligee agree otherwise, 29 deduct and withhold from paid parental leave compensation payable to an individual 30 who owes child support obligations 31 (1) the amount specified by the individual to the department to be 01 deducted and withheld under this subsection, if neither (2) nor (3) of this subsection is 02 applicable; 03 (2) the amount specified in an agreement submitted to the department 04 under 42 U.S.C. 654(19)(B)(i) (sec. 454(19)(B)(i), Social Security Act), by the child 05 support services agency of the Department of Revenue, unless (3) of this subsection is 06 applicable; or 07 (3) any amount required to be deducted and withheld through legal 08 process, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 662(e) (sec. 462(e), Social Security Act), properly 09 served on the department. 10 (c) The department shall pay an amount deducted and withheld under (b) of 11 this section to the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue. 12 (d) An amount deducted and withheld under (b) of this section shall for all 13 purposes be treated as if it were paid to the individual as paid parental leave and paid 14 by that individual to the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue 15 in satisfaction of the individual's child support obligations. 16 (e) This section applies only if appropriate arrangements have been made for 17 reimbursement by the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue for 18 the administrative costs incurred by the department under this section. 19 (f) In this section, "child support obligation" includes only obligations that are 20 being enforced under a plan described in 42 U.S.C. 654 (sec. 454, Social Security 21 Act), which has been approved by the United States Secretary of Health and Human 22 Services under 42 U.S.C. 651-665 (Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act). 23 Sec. 23.10.775.

Qualifying purpose. An eligible employee may use paid 20 parental leave when the employee needs to be absent from work to 21 (1) care for a child within 12 months of the 22 (A) anticipated birth of that child to, adoption of that child by, 23 or placement of that child with the eligible employee; or 24 (B) appointment of the eligible employee as the legal guardian 25 of that child; or 26 (2) complete an adoption, legal guardianship, or foster placement 27 process of a child before the child is adopted by or placed with the employee. 28 Sec. 23.10.720. Paid parental leave claim. (a) The department shall establish 29 by regulation procedures for filing a claim for paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 30 - 23.10.795, including a procedure for certifying that the leave is for a qualifying 31 purpose under AS 23.10.715. 01 (b) An employee may file a claim with the department for paid parental leave 02 not more than 60 days before the anticipated start date of the qualifying absence from 03 work nor more than 90 days after the date on which the qualifying absence from work 04 began. The department may waive the 90-day filing deadline for good cause. The 05 department may process a claim without the eligible employee providing exact dates 06 of an anticipated qualifying absence from work. The department may adjust claim data 07 through a claim modification process established by the department. 08 (c) The department may accept any of the following as sufficient evidence that 09 a paid parental leave claim is for a qualifying purpose: 10 (1) the child's birth certificate; 11 (2) a document from the child's health care provider or the health care 12 provider of the person who gave birth to the child, stating the child's date of birth; 13 (3) a document from the child's health care provider, the adoption 14 agency involved in the adoption, or another individual approved by the department 15 confirming the adoption or anticipated adoption and the date of the adoption or 16 anticipated adoption; 17 (4) a document from the foster care agency involved in the child's 18 placement, or from another individual approved by the department, confirming the 19 placement or anticipated placement of the child for foster care; 20 (5) a form signed by the employee acknowledging paternity of the 21 child that meets the requirements of AS 18.50.165; or 22 (6) a document from a state or tribal court confirming a petition for or 23 decree of legal guardianship of the child. 24 Sec. 23.10.725. Eligibility; benefit amount; duration. (a) An employee who 25 is paid at least $2,500 in wages during at least two of the calendar quarters of the 26 employee's base period is eligible to receive paid parental leave beginning the first day 27 of absence from work for a qualifying purpose under AS 23.10.715. 28 (b) The department shall calculate an employee's base period for purposes of 29 (a) of this section using the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters 30 immediately preceding the first day of the employee's benefit year, except that, if an 31 employee would not otherwise be eligible for paid parental leave because of the use of 01 a base period that does not include the most recently completed calendar quarter 02 immediately preceding the first day of the employee's benefit year, the department 03 shall calculate the employee's base period and determine the employee's eligibility 04 using the four most recently completed calendar quarters before the start of the benefit 05 year. For an individual who has been separated from employment for not more than 26 06 weeks, the department shall calculate the individual's base period using the first four 07 of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's 08 separation from employment, except that, if an individual would not otherwise be 09 eligible for paid parental leave because of the use of a base period that does not 10 include the most recently completed calendar quarter, the department shall calculate 11 the individual's base period and determine the individual's eligibility using the four 12 most recently completed calendar quarters before the start of the benefit year. 13 (c) The department shall determine an eligible employee's weekly benefit in 14 the same manner as provided in AS 23.20.350(d). The department shall calculate the 15 employee's weekly benefit in accordance with AS 23.10.730 for employees using the 16 accelerated benefit option. 17 (d) The maximum number of weeks for which an eligible employee may take 18 paid parental leave, and for which paid parental leave insurance benefits are payable in 19 a benefit year, is between eight and 26 weeks, cumulative, as determined by the 20 department. The department shall determine and make public the maximum duration 21 of the parental leave benefit each year, based on fund solvency, forecasted use, and 22 actuarial studies completed under AS 23.10.780. For employees using the accelerated 23 benefit option, the department shall calculate the number of weeks an eligible 24 employee may take paid parental leave in accordance with AS 23.10.730. 25 (e) In this section, "benefit year" means a period of 52 consecutive weeks 26 beginning at 12:00 a.m. of the Sunday preceding the day that an eligible employee 27 first files a claim for paid parental leave and, thereafter, the period of 52 consecutive 28 weeks beginning at 12:00 a.m. of the Sunday preceding the day that the insured 29 worker next files the claim after the end of the eligible employee's last preceding 30 benefit year; however, for an eligible employee covered by this subsection, "benefit 31 year" also means a period of 53 weeks if the filing of a claim for paid parental leave 01 would result in overlapping any quarter of the base year of a previously filed request 02 for paid parental leave. 03 Sec. 23.10.730. Accelerated benefit option. An eligible employee may choose 04 to receive the paid parental leave benefit on an accelerated basis. For each week the 05 employee elects the accelerated benefit option, the employee shall receive double the 06 weekly benefit amount to which the employee is entitled. However, for each week the 07 employee chooses the accelerated benefit option, the duration of the benefit is reduced 08 by a corresponding week. 09 Sec. 23.10.735. Coordination of benefits. (a) Leave taken under the paid 10 parental leave program shall run concurrently with leave that also qualifies as leave 11 under 29 U.S.C. 2601 - 2654 (Family and Medical Leave Act) or AS 39.20.500 - 12 39.20.550. 13 (b) An employer may require that payments for paid parental leave under 14 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 be made concurrently with, or coordinated with, payments 15 or leave provided under a short-term disability policy or a separate bank of paid time 16 off designated specifically for parental leave under a collective bargaining agreement 17 or employer policy. The employer must provide employees written notice of this 18 requirement. 19 (c) An employee may not be required to use or exhaust any accrued vacation 20 leave, sick leave, or other paid time off before or while receiving paid parental leave 21 benefits under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. However, the employee may choose to use 22 accrued vacation leave, sick leave, or other paid time off while receiving paid parental 23 leave benefits under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 if the total amount received does not 24 exceed the employee's average weekly earnings. 25 (d) Paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 does not relieve an 26 employer from the obligation to comply with more generous terms included in a 27 collective bargaining agreement or employment contract. 28 Sec. 23.10.740. Disqualification. In addition to any other penalty that may 29 apply, an employee may be disqualified from paid parental leave benefits for up to one 30 year if the department determines the employee intentionally made a false statement or 31 misrepresentation of a material fact, or intentionally failed to report a material fact, to 01 obtain paid parental leave. 02 Sec. 23.10.745. Appeals. The department shall establish a process for an 03 employee to appeal a determination by the department regarding a paid parental leave 04 claim within 90 days after receiving notice of the determination. 05 Sec. 23.10.750. Recovery of improper payments. (a) An employee who 06 receives paid parental leave to which the employee is not entitled under AS 23.10.700 07 - 23.10.795 shall repay to the department the amount improperly paid. The department 08 shall deposit the payment in the parental leave fund account established in 09 AS 23.10.705. 10 (b) The department shall promptly prepare and send a notice of determination 11 to the employee at the employee's last address of record, stating that the employee is 12 required to repay the amount of paid parental leave received in error. If the employee 13 does not repay the amount received in error within a reasonable time set by the 14 department, the department shall deduct the amount from future paid parental leave 15 benefits owed to the employee or from the permanent fund dividend of the employee 16 under AS 43.23.140(b)(6). However, the department may waive repayment of all or a 17 portion of the amount of paid parental leave received in error if the department 18 determines that the employee has died or has acted in good faith when claiming and 19 receiving paid parental leave benefits and that requiring repayment would be unfair or 20 inequitable. 21 (c) If the employee has not repaid the paid parental leave benefit or if the 22 amount has not been deducted from future benefits or the permanent fund dividend of 23 the employee within two years after the last day of the year in which payment was 24 made, the commissioner may declare the amount uncollectible. 25 Sec. 23.10.755. Public education and outreach campaign. The department 26 shall conduct a public education and outreach campaign to educate employees and 27 employers about the availability of paid parental leave. 28 Sec. 23.10.760. Employment protection; health insurance maintenance; 29 enforcement. (a) An eligible employee who takes paid parental leave under 30 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 is entitled to return to the position the employee held when 31 the leave began or to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent seniority, 01 pay, benefits, working hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, 02 including service credits the employee was entitled to at the start of paid parental 03 leave. 04 (b) During any period of qualified paid parental leave, the employer shall 05 maintain the employee's health care benefits on the same terms as before the leave 06 began. The employee shall continue to pay the employee's share of the cost of any 07 health care benefits. 08 (c) An employer may not take or threaten any adverse employment action or 09 discriminate against the employee for applying for or using paid parental leave under 10 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. 11 (d) An employer may not take any action that prevents or discourages an 12 employee from taking paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795, including 13 failing to provide timely and complete information required by the department or 14 reporting or threatening to report suspected citizenship or immigration status of the 15 employee or an employee's family member. 16 (e) An employer may not adopt or enforce a policy that allows paid parental 17 leave taken under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 to be considered as an absence that could 18 result in discipline, discharge, demotion, suspension, or any other adverse action 19 against the employee. 20 (f) The department shall establish a complaint process by regulation for an 21 employee who believes the employee's employer violated this section. A complaint 22 must be filed within two years after the violation occurred or the date the employee 23 reasonably should have known about the violation, whichever is later. 24 (g) After granting the employer a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, or 25 after the employer acknowledges that a violation occurred, the department may 26 determine whether a violation occurred. If the department determines a violation 27 occurred, the department may order the employer to remedy the violation, which may 28 include 29 (1) granting the requested paid parental leave; 30 (2) providing up to two years of back pay, plus interest; 31 (3) reinstating the employee; 01 (4) paying to the complainant attorney fees allowed under the Alaska 02 Rules of Civil Procedure; 03 (5) other relief the department considers appropriate. 04 (h) After the department issues a final determination, either party may appeal 05 the determination to a court of competent jurisdiction. 06 Sec. 23.10.765. Notice to employees. (a) An employer shall provide written 07 notice to each employee upon hiring, and annually thereafter, of the benefits available 08 under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795.

(a) Notwithstanding any other 22 provision of AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795, an individual filing a new claim for paid 23 parental leave must disclose whether child support obligations are owed by that 24 individual. If the individual discloses that child support obligations are owed and the 25 individual is determined to be eligible for paid parental leave, the department shall 26 notify the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue that the 27 individual has been determined to be eligible for paid parental leave. 28 (b) The department shall, unless the obligor and obligee agree otherwise, 29 deduct and withhold from paid parental leave compensation payable to an individual 30 who owes child support obligations 31 (1) the amount specified by the individual to the department to be 01 deducted and withheld under this subsection, if neither (2) nor (3) of this subsection is 02 applicable; 03 (2) the amount specified in an agreement submitted to the department 04 under 42 U.S.C. 654(19)(B)(i) (sec. 454(19)(B)(i), Social Security Act), by the child 05 support services agency of the Department of Revenue, unless (3) of this subsection is 06 applicable; or 07 (3) any amount required to be deducted and withheld through legal 08 process, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 662(e) (sec. 462(e), Social Security Act), properly 09 served on the department. 10 (c) The department shall pay an amount deducted and withheld under (b) of 11 this section to the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue. 12 (d) An amount deducted and withheld under (b) of this section shall for all 13 purposes be treated as if it were paid to the individual as paid parental leave and paid 14 by that individual to the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue 15 in satisfaction of the individual's child support obligations. 16 (e) This section applies only if appropriate arrangements have been made for 17 reimbursement by the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue for 18 the administrative costs incurred by the department under this section. 19 (f) In this section, "child support obligation" includes only obligations that are 20 being enforced under a plan described in 42 U.S.C. 654 (sec. 454, Social Security 21 Act), which has been approved by the United States Secretary of Health and Human 22 Services under 42 U.S.C. 651-665 (Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act). 23 Sec. 23.10.775.
