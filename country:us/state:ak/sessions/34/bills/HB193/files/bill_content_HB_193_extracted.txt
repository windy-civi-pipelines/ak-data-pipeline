Special employee unemployment contribution for paid 04 parental leave program. (a) In the manner provided in AS 23.20 and for the benefit 05 of the paid parental leave program, the department shall collect from each employee 06 an amount equal to .15 percent of the wages, as set out in AS 23.20.175, on which the 07 employee is required to make contributions under AS 23.20.290(d). The department 08 shall remit money collected under this subsection in accordance with AS 37.10.050. 09 (b) Notwithstanding AS 23.20.290(d), the department shall credit each 10 employee with an amount equal to the amount collected from the employee under (a) 11 of this section against unemployment contributions owed by the employee under 12 AS 23.20. 13 (c) The department shall assess and collect, under AS 23.20.185 - 23.20.275, 14 interest and penalties for delinquent reports and payments due under this section. 15 Interest and penalties collected shall be handled in accordance with AS 23.20.130(d). 16 Sec. 23.10.715. Qualifying purpose. An eligible employee may use paid 17 parental leave when the employee needs to be absent from work to 18 (1) care for a child within 12 months of the anticipated birth of that 19 child to, adoption of that child by, or placement of that child with the eligible 20 employee; or 21 (2) complete an adoption or foster placement process of a child before 22 the child is adopted by or placed with the employee. 23 Sec. 23.10.720. Paid parental leave claim. (a) The department shall establish 24 by regulation procedures for filing a claim for paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 25 - 23.10.795, including a procedure for certifying that the leave is for a qualifying 26 purpose under AS 23.10.715. 27 (b) An employee may file a claim with the department for paid parental leave 28 not more than 60 days before the anticipated start date of the qualifying absence from 29 work nor more than 90 days after the date on which the qualifying absence from work 30 began. The department may waive the 90-day filing deadline for good cause. The 31 department may process a claim without the eligible employee providing exact dates 01 of an anticipated qualifying absence from work. The department may adjust claim data 02 through a claim modification process established by the department. 03 (c) The department may accept any of the following as sufficient evidence that 04 a paid parental leave claim is for a qualifying purpose: 05 (1) the child's birth certificate; 06 (2) a document from the child's health care provider or the health care 07 provider of the person who gave birth to the child, stating the child's date of birth; 08 (3) a document from the child's health care provider, the adoption 09 agency involved in the adoption, or another individual approved by the department 10 confirming the adoption or anticipated adoption and the date of the adoption or 11 anticipated adoption; 12 (4) a document from the foster care agency involved in the child's 13 placement, or from another individual approved by the department, confirming the 14 placement or anticipated placement of the child for foster care; or 15 (5) a form signed by the employee acknowledging paternity of the 16 child that meets the requirements of AS 18.50.165. 17 Sec. 23.10.725. Eligibility; benefit amount; duration. (a) An employee who 18 is paid at least $2,500 in wages during at least two of the calendar quarters of the 19 employee's base period is eligible to receive paid parental leave beginning the first day 20 of absence from work for a qualifying purpose under AS 23.10.715. 21 (b) The department shall calculate an employee's base period for purposes of 22 (a) of this section using the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters 23 immediately preceding the first day of the employee's benefit year, except that, if an 24 employee would not otherwise be eligible for paid parental leave because of the use of 25 a base period that does not include the most recently completed calendar quarter 26 immediately preceding the first day of the employee's benefit year, the department 27 shall calculate the employee's base period and determine the employee's eligibility 28 using the four most recently completed calendar quarters before the start of the benefit 29 year. For an individual who has been separated from employment for not more than 26 30 weeks, the department shall calculate the individual's base period using the first four 31 of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's 01 separation from employment, except that, if an individual would not otherwise be 02 eligible for paid parental leave because of the use of a base period that does not 03 include the most recently completed calendar quarter, the department shall calculate 04 the individual's base period and determine the individual's eligibility using the four 05 most recently completed calendar quarters before the start of the benefit year. 06 (c) The department shall determine an eligible employee's weekly benefit in 07 the same manner as provided in AS 23.20.350(d). The department shall prorate the 08 weekly benefit amount in accordance with AS 23.10.730 for an employee using an 09 intermittent or a reduced leave schedule. 10 (d) The maximum number of weeks for which an eligible employee may take 11 paid parental leave, and for which paid parental leave insurance benefits are payable in 12 a benefit year, is 26 weeks, cumulative. For employees using intermittent leave or a 13 reduced leave schedule, the department shall calculate the cumulative period of weeks 14 used by the employee in accordance with AS 23.10.730. 15 (e) In this section, "benefit year" means a period of 52 consecutive weeks 16 beginning at 12:00 a.m. of the Sunday preceding the day that an eligible employee 17 first files a claim for paid parental leave and, thereafter, the period of 52 consecutive 18 weeks beginning at 12:00 a.m. of the Sunday preceding the day that the insured 19 worker next files the claim after the end of the eligible employee's last preceding 20 benefit year; however, for an eligible employee covered by this subsection, "benefit 21 year" also means a period of 53 weeks if the filing of a claim for paid parental leave 22 would result in overlapping any quarter of the base year of a previously filed request 23 for paid parental leave. 24 Sec. 23.10.730. Intermittent or reduced leave schedule. (a) An eligible 25 employee may choose to take paid parental leave on an intermittent or reduced leave 26 schedule rather than taking the full leave period consecutively. The department shall 27 prorate paid parental leave benefits taken in increments of less than one week. The 28 minimum amount of leave that may be claimed is one day during any claim week. 29 (b) Paid parental leave taken under this section may not result in a reduction of 30 the total amount of leave a covered employee is entitled to take. 31 Sec. 23.10.735. Elective coverage. (a) A self-employed individual may elect 01 coverage under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 for an initial period of not less than three 02 years. 03 (b) A self-employed individual who elects coverage is eligible for paid 04 parental leave benefits as soon as the self-employed person meets the requirements 05 under AS 23.10.725. 06 (c) A self-employed individual who has elected coverage may withdraw from 07 coverage within 30 days after the end of the three-year coverage period, or at other 08 times specified by the department in regulation, by submitting written notice to the 09 department. A withdrawal takes effect not sooner than 30 days after the notice is filed. 10 (d) The department shall relieve an individual who has elected coverage under 11 this section from obligations under this section if the individual is no longer self- 12 employed or if the individual no longer works in the state. 13 (e) As a condition of election of coverage, a self-employed individual shall 14 agree to supply any information concerning income that the department considers 15 necessary. 16 Sec. 23.10.740. Coordination of benefits. (a) Leave taken under the paid 17 parental leave program shall run concurrently with leave that also qualifies as leave 18 under 29 U.S.C. 2601 - 2654 (Family and Medical Leave Act) or AS 39.20.500 - 19 39.20.550. 20 (b) An employer may require that payments for paid parental leave under 21 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 be made concurrently with, or coordinated with, payments 22 or leave provided under a short-term disability policy or a separate bank of paid time 23 off designated specifically for parental leave under a collective bargaining agreement 24 or employer policy. The employer must provide employees written notice of this 25 requirement. 26 (c) An employee may not be required to use or exhaust any accrued vacation 27 leave, sick leave, or other paid time off before or while receiving paid parental leave 28 benefits under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. However, the employee may choose to use 29 accrued vacation leave, sick leave, or other paid time off while receiving paid parental 30 leave benefits under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 if the total amount received does not 31 exceed the employee's average weekly earnings. 01 (d) Paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 does not relieve an 02 employer from the obligation to comply with more generous terms included in a 03 collective bargaining agreement or employment contract. 04 Sec. 23.10.745. Disqualification. In addition to any other penalty that may 05 apply, an employee may be disqualified from paid parental leave benefits for up to one 06 year if the department determines the employee intentionally made a false statement or 07 misrepresentation of a material fact, or intentionally failed to report a material fact, to 08 obtain paid parental leave. 09 Sec. 23.10.750. Appeals. The department shall establish a process for an 10 employee to appeal a determination by the department regarding a paid parental leave 11 claim within 90 days after receiving notice of the determination. 12 Sec. 23.10.755. Recovery of improper payments. (a) An employee who 13 receives paid parental leave to which the employee is not entitled under AS 23.10.700 14 - 23.10.795 shall repay to the department the amount improperly paid. The department 15 shall deposit the payment in the parental leave fund account established in 16 AS 23.10.705. 17 (b) The department shall promptly prepare and send a notice of determination 18 to the employee at the employee's last address of record, stating that the employee is 19 required to repay the amount of paid parental leave received in error. If the employee 20 does not repay the amount received in error within a reasonable time set by the 21 department, the department shall deduct the amount from future paid parental leave 22 benefits owed to the employee or from the permanent fund dividend of the employee 23 under AS 43.23.140(b)(6). However, the department may waive repayment of all or a 24 portion of the amount of paid parental leave received in error if the department 25 determines that the employee has died or has acted in good faith when claiming and 26 receiving paid parental leave benefits and that requiring repayment would be unfair or 27 inequitable. 28 (c) If the employee has not repaid the paid parental leave benefit or if the 29 amount has not been deducted from future benefits or the permanent fund dividend of 30 the employee within two years after the last day of the year in which payment was 31 made, the commissioner may declare the amount uncollectible. 01 Sec. 23.10.760. Annual report. On or before July 1 of each year, the 02 department shall submit a report to the senate secretary and the chief clerk of the 03 house of representatives and notify the legislature that the report is available.

Employment protection; health insurance maintenance; 23 enforcement. (a) An eligible employee who takes paid parental leave under 24 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 is entitled to return to the position the employee held when 25 the leave began or to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent seniority, 26 pay, benefits, working hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, 27 including service credits the employee was entitled to at the start of paid parental 28 leave. 29 (b) During any period of qualified paid parental leave, the employer shall 30 maintain the employee's health care benefits on the same terms as before the leave 31 began. The employee shall continue to pay the employee's share of the cost of any 01 health care benefits. 02 (c) An employer may not take or threaten any adverse employment action or 03 discriminate against the employee for applying for or using paid parental leave under 04 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. 05 (d) An employer may not take any action that prevents or discourages an 06 employee from taking paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795, including 07 failing to provide timely and complete information required by the department or 08 reporting or threatening to report suspected citizenship or immigration status of the 09 employee or an employee's family member. 10 (e) An employer may not adopt or enforce a policy that allows paid parental 11 leave taken under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 to be considered as an absence that could 12 result in discipline, discharge, demotion, suspension, or any other adverse action 13 against the employee. 14 (f) The department shall establish a complaint process by regulation for an 15 employee who believes the employee's employer violated this section. A complaint 16 must be filed within two years after the violation occurred or the date the employee 17 reasonably should have known about the violation, whichever is later. 18 (g) After granting the employer a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, or 19 after the employer acknowledges that a violation occurred, the department may 20 determine whether a violation occurred. If the department determines a violation 21 occurred, the department may order the employer to remedy the violation, which may 22 include 23 (1) granting the requested paid parental leave; 24 (2) providing up to two years of back pay, plus interest; 25 (3) reinstating the employee; 26 (4) paying to the complainant attorney fees allowed under the Alaska 27 Rules of Civil Procedure; 28 (5) other relief the department considers appropriate. 29 (h) After the department issues a final determination, either party may appeal 30 the determination to a court of competent jurisdiction. 31 Sec. 23.10.775.

For employees using intermittent leave or a 13 reduced leave schedule, the department shall calculate the cumulative period of weeks 14 used by the employee in accordance with AS 23.10.730. 15 (e) In this section, "benefit year" means a period of 52 consecutive weeks 16 beginning at 12:00 a.m. of the Sunday preceding the day that an eligible employee 17 first files a claim for paid parental leave and, thereafter, the period of 52 consecutive 18 weeks beginning at 12:00 a.m. of the Sunday preceding the day that the insured 19 worker next files the claim after the end of the eligible employee's last preceding 20 benefit year; however, for an eligible employee covered by this subsection, "benefit 21 year" also means a period of 53 weeks if the filing of a claim for paid parental leave 22 would result in overlapping any quarter of the base year of a previously filed request 23 for paid parental leave. 24 Sec. 23.10.730. Intermittent or reduced leave schedule. (a) An eligible 25 employee may choose to take paid parental leave on an intermittent or reduced leave 26 schedule rather than taking the full leave period consecutively. The department shall 27 prorate paid parental leave benefits taken in increments of less than one week. The 28 minimum amount of leave that may be claimed is one day during any claim week. 29 (b) Paid parental leave taken under this section may not result in a reduction of 30 the total amount of leave a covered employee is entitled to take. 31 Sec. 23.10.735. Elective coverage. (a) A self-employed individual may elect 01 coverage under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 for an initial period of not less than three 02 years. 03 (b) A self-employed individual who elects coverage is eligible for paid 04 parental leave benefits as soon as the self-employed person meets the requirements 05 under AS 23.10.725. 06 (c) A self-employed individual who has elected coverage may withdraw from 07 coverage within 30 days after the end of the three-year coverage period, or at other 08 times specified by the department in regulation, by submitting written notice to the 09 department. A withdrawal takes effect not sooner than 30 days after the notice is filed. 10 (d) The department shall relieve an individual who has elected coverage under 11 this section from obligations under this section if the individual is no longer self- 12 employed or if the individual no longer works in the state. 13 (e) As a condition of election of coverage, a self-employed individual shall 14 agree to supply any information concerning income that the department considers 15 necessary. 16 Sec. 23.10.740. Coordination of benefits. (a) Leave taken under the paid 17 parental leave program shall run concurrently with leave that also qualifies as leave 18 under 29 U.S.C. 2601 - 2654 (Family and Medical Leave Act) or AS 39.20.500 - 19 39.20.550. 20 (b) An employer may require that payments for paid parental leave under 21 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 be made concurrently with, or coordinated with, payments 22 or leave provided under a short-term disability policy or a separate bank of paid time 23 off designated specifically for parental leave under a collective bargaining agreement 24 or employer policy. The employer must provide employees written notice of this 25 requirement. 26 (c) An employee may not be required to use or exhaust any accrued vacation 27 leave, sick leave, or other paid time off before or while receiving paid parental leave 28 benefits under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. However, the employee may choose to use 29 accrued vacation leave, sick leave, or other paid time off while receiving paid parental 30 leave benefits under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 if the total amount received does not 31 exceed the employee's average weekly earnings. 01 (d) Paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 does not relieve an 02 employer from the obligation to comply with more generous terms included in a 03 collective bargaining agreement or employment contract. 04 Sec. 23.10.745. Disqualification. In addition to any other penalty that may 05 apply, an employee may be disqualified from paid parental leave benefits for up to one 06 year if the department determines the employee intentionally made a false statement or 07 misrepresentation of a material fact, or intentionally failed to report a material fact, to 08 obtain paid parental leave. 09 Sec. 23.10.750. Appeals. The department shall establish a process for an 10 employee to appeal a determination by the department regarding a paid parental leave 11 claim within 90 days after receiving notice of the determination. 12 Sec. 23.10.755. Recovery of improper payments. (a) An employee who 13 receives paid parental leave to which the employee is not entitled under AS 23.10.700 14 - 23.10.795 shall repay to the department the amount improperly paid. The department 15 shall deposit the payment in the parental leave fund account established in 16 AS 23.10.705. 17 (b) The department shall promptly prepare and send a notice of determination 18 to the employee at the employee's last address of record, stating that the employee is 19 required to repay the amount of paid parental leave received in error. If the employee 20 does not repay the amount received in error within a reasonable time set by the 21 department, the department shall deduct the amount from future paid parental leave 22 benefits owed to the employee or from the permanent fund dividend of the employee 23 under AS 43.23.140(b)(6). However, the department may waive repayment of all or a 24 portion of the amount of paid parental leave received in error if the department 25 determines that the employee has died or has acted in good faith when claiming and 26 receiving paid parental leave benefits and that requiring repayment would be unfair or 27 inequitable. 28 (c) If the employee has not repaid the paid parental leave benefit or if the 29 amount has not been deducted from future benefits or the permanent fund dividend of 30 the employee within two years after the last day of the year in which payment was 31 made, the commissioner may declare the amount uncollectible. 01 Sec. 23.10.760. Annual report. On or before July 1 of each year, the 02 department shall submit a report to the senate secretary and the chief clerk of the 03 house of representatives and notify the legislature that the report is available. The 04 department shall make the report available to the public on the department's Internet 05 website. The report must include 06 (1) the actual and projected number of participants in the program; 07 (2) demographic information on program participants, including 08 occupation and employment type and whether the leave was taken for the birth of a 09 child, adoption of a child, or the placement of a foster child; 10 (3) the average weekly benefit; 11 (4) the average leave duration; 12 (5) the current and projected fund balance; 13 (6) the processing time for initial claims and determinations; 14 (7) the number of claim denials and stated reasons for claim denials; 15 (8) the number of appeals filed and outcomes related to those appeals; 16 (9) the average length of time between application and receipt of 17 benefits; 18 (10) a description of the department's outreach efforts. 19 Sec. 23.10.765. Public education and outreach campaign. The department 20 shall conduct a public education and outreach campaign to educate employees and 21 employers about the availability of paid parental leave. 22 Sec. 23.10.770. Employment protection; health insurance maintenance; 23 enforcement. (a) An eligible employee who takes paid parental leave under 24 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 is entitled to return to the position the employee held when 25 the leave began or to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent seniority, 26 pay, benefits, working hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, 27 including service credits the employee was entitled to at the start of paid parental 28 leave. 29 (b) During any period of qualified paid parental leave, the employer shall 30 maintain the employee's health care benefits on the same terms as before the leave 31 began. The employee shall continue to pay the employee's share of the cost of any 01 health care benefits. 02 (c) An employer may not take or threaten any adverse employment action or 03 discriminate against the employee for applying for or using paid parental leave under 04 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. 05 (d) An employer may not take any action that prevents or discourages an 06 employee from taking paid parental leave under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795, including 07 failing to provide timely and complete information required by the department or 08 reporting or threatening to report suspected citizenship or immigration status of the 09 employee or an employee's family member. 10 (e) An employer may not adopt or enforce a policy that allows paid parental 11 leave taken under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 to be considered as an absence that could 12 result in discipline, discharge, demotion, suspension, or any other adverse action 13 against the employee. 14 (f) The department shall establish a complaint process by regulation for an 15 employee who believes the employee's employer violated this section. A complaint 16 must be filed within two years after the violation occurred or the date the employee 17 reasonably should have known about the violation, whichever is later. 18 (g) After granting the employer a reasonable opportunity for a fair hearing, or 19 after the employer acknowledges that a violation occurred, the department may 20 determine whether a violation occurred. If the department determines a violation 21 occurred, the department may order the employer to remedy the violation, which may 22 include 23 (1) granting the requested paid parental leave; 24 (2) providing up to two years of back pay, plus interest; 25 (3) reinstating the employee; 26 (4) paying to the complainant attorney fees allowed under the Alaska 27 Rules of Civil Procedure; 28 (5) other relief the department considers appropriate. 29 (h) After the department issues a final determination, either party may appeal 30 the determination to a court of competent jurisdiction. 31 Sec. 23.10.775. Notice to employees. (a) An employer shall provide written 01 notice to each employee upon hiring, and annually thereafter, of the benefits available 02 under AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. The notice must include 03 (1) the employee's right to paid parental leave benefits under 04 AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795 and the terms under which the benefits may be used; 05 (2) the amount of paid parental leave available; 06 (3) the procedure for filing a claim for paid parental leave benefits; 07 (4) notice that discrimination and retaliatory personnel actions against 08 the employee for requesting, applying for, or using paid parental leave benefits is 09 prohibited; and 10 (5) notice that the employee has a right to file a complaint for a 11 violation of AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795. 12 (b) Each employer shall display and maintain a poster in a conspicuous place 13 accessible to employees at the employer's place of business that contains the 14 information required by this section in a form approved by the department. 15 Sec. 23.10.780. Child support interception. (a) Notwithstanding any other 16 provision of AS 23.10.700 - 23.10.795, an individual filing a new claim for paid 17 parental leave must disclose whether child support obligations are owed by that 18 individual. If the individual discloses that child support obligations are owed and the 19 individual is determined to be eligible for paid parental leave, the department shall 20 notify the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue that the 21 individual has been determined to be eligible for paid parental leave. 22 (b) The department shall, unless the obligor and obligee agree otherwise, 23 deduct and withhold from paid parental leave compensation payable to an individual 24 who owes child support obligations 25 (1) the amount specified by the individual to the department to be 26 deducted and withheld under this subsection, if neither (2) nor (3) of this subsection is 27 applicable; 28 (2) the amount specified in an agreement submitted to the department 29 under 42 U.S.C. 654(19)(B)(i) (sec. 454(19)(B)(i), Social Security Act), by the child 30 support services agency of the Department of Revenue, unless (3) of this subsection is 31 applicable; or 01 (3) any amount required to be deducted and withheld through legal 02 process, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 662(e) (sec. 462(e), Social Security Act), properly 03 served on the department. 04 (c) The department shall pay an amount deducted and withheld under (b) of 05 this section to the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue. 06 (d) An amount deducted and withheld under (b) of this section shall for all 07 purposes be treated as if it were paid to the individual as paid parental leave and paid 08 by that individual to the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue 09 in satisfaction of the individual's child support obligations. 10 (e) This section applies only if appropriate arrangements have been made for 11 reimbursement by the child support services agency of the Department of Revenue for 12 the administrative costs incurred by the department under this section. 13 (f) In this section, "child support obligation" includes only obligations that are 14 being enforced under a plan described in 42 U.S.C. 654 (sec. 454, Social Security 15 Act), which has been approved by the United States Secretary of Health and Human 16 Services under 42 U.S.C. 651-665 (Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act). 17 Sec. 23.10.785.
