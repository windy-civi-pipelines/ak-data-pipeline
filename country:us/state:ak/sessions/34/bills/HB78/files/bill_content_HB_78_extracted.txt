AS 14.25 is amended by adding a new section to read: 22 Sec. 14.25.044. Election of defined benefit retirement plan by reemployed 23 teachers. (a) A teacher may make a one-time election to participate in the defined 24 benefit retirement plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 if the teacher 25 (1) became a member of the defined contribution retirement plan under 26 AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 after June 30, 2006, and before July 1, 2025; 27 (2) is not employed by an employer on July 1, 2025; 28 (3) is reemployed by an employer after July 1, 2025; and 29 (4) before the date of reemployment, 30 (A) has not received a distribution of the entire balance in the 31 teacher's individual account under the defined contribution retirement plan 01 under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590; or 02 (B) has received a rollover distribution of the entire balance in 03 the teacher's individual account in the plan under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 04 and has within 180 days of reemployment had all or part of a direct rollover 05 distribution from an eligible retirement plan owned by the teacher paid directly 06 into the teacher's individual account under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590. 07 (b) An election under (a) of this section may be made not more than 180 days 08 after the date of reemployment. A reemployed teacher electing to participate under (a) 09 of this section shall use the balance of the member's individual account in the plan 10 under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590, including any rollover contributions, to purchase 11 credited service in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. An election made under 12 (a) of this section must be made in writing in the manner prescribed by the 13 administrator. An election made by a teacher who is married is not effective unless the 14 election is signed by the teacher's spouse. The administrator shall provide a teacher 15 who is eligible to make an election under (a) of this section with information about the 16 potential consequences of the teacher's election, including calculations to illustrate the 17 effect of moving the teacher's retirement plan from a defined contribution retirement 18 plan to a defined benefit retirement plan. 19 (c) An election made under (a) of this section to participate in the plan under 20 AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 is irrevocable. On the effective date of the election, the 21 teacher shall be enrolled as a member of the plan, and the teacher's participation in the 22 plan shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the plan. The teacher's 23 enrollment in the plan is retroactive to the date of hire. 24 (d) When a teacher makes an election under this section, the administrator 25 shall cause the total amount of the teacher's member and employer contributions to the 26 plan under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590, with investment earnings and losses through the 27 day of the teacher's election to participate as a member in the plan under AS 14.25.009 28 - 14.25.220, to be actuarially calculated and, subject to (f) of this section, transferred 29 to the retirement fund in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. On the effective 30 date of the teacher's participation in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220, the 31 teacher shall be credited with service in the plan. The board shall determine the cost of 01 the teacher's actual service time based on the teacher's accrued actuarial liability of 02 pension benefits in the plan, and credit the teacher with service time equal to the value 03 actuarially calculated and transferred to the retirement fund in the plan under 04 AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. The board shall adopt regulations establishing transfer 05 procedures. The transfer may not occur later than 60 days after the date the 06 administrator receives the teacher's election, unless the major financial markets for 07 securities available for a transfer are seriously disrupted by an unforeseen event that 08 also causes the suspension of trading on a national securities exchange in the country 09 where the securities were issued; in that event, the 60-day period may be extended by 10 a resolution of the board. A transfer is not commissionable or subject to a fee and may 11 be in the form of cash or a security as determined by the board. The value of a security 12 shall be assessed on the date the security is received in the teacher's account. 13 (e) When making a transfer under (d) of this section or a transfer for a 14 reemployed teacher subject to the plan under AS 14.25.040(h), the administrator shall 15 transfer 16 (1) an amount equal to the decrease in the accrued actuarial liability of 17 the death and disability trust in the plan established under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 18 resulting from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the most recent actuarial 19 valuation of the death and disability trust, from the death and disability trust in the 20 plan established under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 to the retirement fund in the plan 21 established under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220; and 22 (2) an amount equal to the increase in the accrued actuarial liability of 23 the health care trust in the plan established under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 resulting 24 from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the actuarial assumptions set out 25 in (g) of this section, from the trust established under AS 39.30.097(b) for the 26 prefunding of medical benefits provided by AS 14.25.480 to the trust established 27 under AS 39.30.097(a) for the prefunding of medical benefits provided by 28 AS 14.25.171. 29 (f) If the value actuarially calculated under (d) of this section is insufficient to 30 pay for service credit equal to the teacher's actual service time, the administrator shall 31 allow the teacher the option of purchasing service credit in an amount up to the 01 amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; however, if that value exceeds the 02 amount needed to pay for service credit equal to the teacher's actual service, the 03 administrator shall cause the excess to be paid to the employee as a rollover transfer 04 either to an individual employee annuity account in the Department of Administration 05 under the terms of AS 39.30.150 - 39.30.180 (State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity 06 Plan) or, if the member's employer does not participate in the State of Alaska 07 Supplemental Annuity Plan, to an eligible retirement plan as defined in 08 AS 14.25.360(d). An excess may not be used to purchase additional service credit in 09 the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. When a reemployed teacher enters the plan 10 under AS 14.25.040(h), the administrator shall allow the teacher to pay for a period of 11 service credit up to the teacher's actual service. When a teacher elects to purchase 12 service credit under this section and does not immediately pay for the service credit 13 purchased, an indebtedness is established. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues 14 on a teacher's indebtedness. If the indebtedness exists when the teacher is appointed to 15 retirement, the administrator shall make a corresponding actuarial adjustment to the 16 benefit payable to the teacher for service in the defined contribution retirement plan. 17 (g) Actuarial assumptions about the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 18 must be based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan, except that the 19 retirement rates are computed at 25 percent of the retirement rates used in the most 20 recent actuarial valuation of the retirement fund plus 75 percent of the retirement rates 21 used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590. 22 (h) The provisions of this section are subject to the requirements of the 23 Internal Revenue Code and the limitations under AS 14.25.010, 14.25.181, 24 14.25.320(c) and (d), and 14.25.490. 25 * Sec. 5. AS 14.25.048(b) is amended to read: 26 (b) An employee or former employee who first became a member of the 27 plan before July 1, 2006, may receive credit for retroactive membership service for 28 employment before June 5, 1988, if the employee or former employee met the 29 requirements listed in (a) of this section at the time of the employment. To receive 30 credit for the retroactive membership service, the employee or former employee shall 31 claim the service and pay the retroactive contributions required under former 01 AS 14.25.061. However, an employee or former employee may not receive retroactive 02 credit under this subsection if the employee received credited service under AS 39.35 03 for the employment. 04 * Sec. 6. AS 14.25.048(c) is amended to read: 05 (c) An employee or former employee who first became a member of the 06 plan before July 1, 2006, and who received credit under AS 39.35 for service that 07 qualifies under (a) of this section may elect to transfer those periods of employment to 08 the plan. To receive credit for retroactive membership service under this subsection, 09 the employee or former employee shall claim the service and pay the retroactive 10 contributions required under former AS 14.25.061. 11 * Sec. 7. AS 14.25.050(a) is amended to read: 12 (a) Except as provided in (c) and (e) of this section, beginning January 1, 13 1991, each member shall contribute to the plan an amount equal to 8.65 percent of the 14 member's base salary accrued from July 1 to the following June 30. [THE 15 EMPLOYER SHALL DEDUCT THE CONTRIBUTION FROM THE MEMBER'S 16 SALARY AT THE END OF EACH PAYROLL PERIOD, AND THE 17 CONTRIBUTION SHALL BE CREDITED BY THE PLAN TO THE MEMBER 18 CONTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE DEDUCTED 19 FROM EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BEFORE THE COMPUTATION OF 20 APPLICABLE FEDERAL TAXES AND SHALL BE TREATED AS EMPLOYER 21 CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE 22 THE OPTION OF MAKING THE PAYROLL DEDUCTION DIRECTLY IN CASH 23 INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CONTRIBUTION PICKED UP BY THE 24 EMPLOYER.] 25 * Sec. 8. AS 14.25.050 is amended by adding new subsections to read: 26 (e) A member who first participates in the plan after June 30, 2006, shall 27 contribute to the plan an amount equal to eight percent of the member's base salary 28 accrued from July 1 to the following June 30. The board may, from time to time, 29 adjust the contribution under this subsection to an amount that, 30 (1) if decreased, is not less than eight percent of the member's base 31 salary; and 01 (2) if increased, is not more than 12 percent of the member's base 02 salary. 03 (f) The employer shall deduct a contribution under this section from the 04 member's salary at the end of each payroll period, and the contribution shall be 05 credited by the plan to the member contribution account. The contributions shall be 06 deducted from member compensation before the computation of applicable federal 07 taxes and shall be treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A 08 member may not have the option of making the payroll deduction directly in cash 09 instead of having the contribution picked up by the employer. 10 (g) The board may increase the member contribution under (e) of this section 11 if the board determines that, unless the contribution is increased, the portion of the 12 liability of the plan that is attributable to all members who first became members of 13 the plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded below 90 percent. The board may not 14 increase the member contribution unless the board increases the employer contribution 15 under AS 14.25.070(a)(2) by an equal amount. The board may decrease the 16 contribution under (e) of this section if the board determines that, after the 17 contribution is decreased, the portion of the liability of the plan that is attributable to 18 all members who first became members of the plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded 19 above 90 percent. The board may not decrease the member contribution unless the 20 board decreases the employer contribution under AS 14.25.070(a)(2) by an equal 21 amount. 22 * Sec. 9. AS 14.25.065(b) is amended to read: 23 (b) The contributions of employers under AS 14.25.070 must be transmitted to 24 the plan for deposit in the retirement fund and the Alaska retiree health care trust at the 25 close of each pay period. If the contributions are not submitted within the prescribed 26 time limit, interest must be assessed on the outstanding contributions at [ONE AND 27 ONE-HALF TIMES] the most recent actuarially determined rate of earnings for the 28 plan from the date that contributions were originally due. Amounts due from an 29 employer and interest as prescribed in this section may be claimed by the 30 administrator from any agency of the state or political subdivision that has in its 31 possession funds of the employer or that is authorized to disburse funds to the 01 employer that are not restricted by statute or appropriation to a specific purpose. The 02 amount claimed shall be certified by the administrator as sufficient to pay the 03 contributions and interest due from the employer. The amount claimed shall be 04 submitted to the administrator for deposit in the retirement fund and the Alaska retiree 05 health care trust. 06 * Sec. 10. AS 14.25.070(a) is amended to read: 07 (a) Each employer shall contribute to the system every payroll period the 08 lesser of 09 (1) an amount calculated by applying a rate of 12.56 percent to the 10 total of all base salaries paid by the employer to active members of the system and to 11 members who are retired from the plan and reemployed under AS 14.20.136, 12 including any adjustments to contributions required by AS 14.25.173(a); or 13 (2) an amount calculated by applying a rate established by the 14 board under AS 37.10.220 to the total of all base salaries paid by the employer to 15 active members of the system and to members who are retired from the plan and 16 reemployed under AS 14.20.136, including any adjustments to contributions 17 required by AS 14.25.173(a); the rate must be at least 12 percent and be sufficient 18 to pay the actuarially determined employer normal cost, all contributions 19 required under AS 14.25.350 and AS 39.30.370, and past service cost for 20 members of the system. 21 * Sec. 11. AS 14.25.070 is amended by adding a new subsection to read: 22 (i) If the legislature appropriates funds for the purpose of decreasing an 23 employer's contribution, the employer's contribution under (a) of this section shall 24 decrease by that amount. 25 * Sec. 12.

The value of a security shall be assessed on the date the security is received in 11 the employee's account. 12 (e) When making a transfer under (d) of this section or a transfer for a 13 reemployed employee subject to the plan under AS 39.35.095(b), the administrator 14 shall transfer 15 (1) an amount equal to the decrease in the accrued actuarial liability of 16 the death and disability trust in the plan under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990 resulting 17 from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the most recent actuarial valuation 18 of the death and disability trust, from the death and disability trust in the plan under 19 AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990 to the pension fund in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 20 39.35.680; and 21 (2) an amount equal to the increase in the accrued actuarial liability of 22 the health care trust in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 resulting from the 23 transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the actuarial assumptions set out in (g) of 24 this section, from the trust established under AS 39.30.097(b) for the prefunding of 25 medical benefits provided by AS 39.35.880 to the trust established under 26 AS 39.30.097(a) for the prefunding of medical benefits provided by AS 39.35.537. 27 (f) If the value actuarially calculated under (d) of this section is insufficient to 28 pay for service credit equal to the employee's actual service, the administrator shall 29 allow the employee the option of purchasing service credit in an amount up to the 30 amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; however, if that value exceeds the 31 amount needed to pay for service credit equal to the employee's actual service, the 01 administrator shall cause the excess to be paid to the employee as a rollover transfer 02 either to an individual employee annuity account in the Department of Administration 03 under the terms of AS 39.30.150 - 39.30.180 (State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity 04 Plan) or, if the member's employer does not participate in the State of Alaska 05 Supplemental Annuity Plan, to an eligible retirement plan as defined in 06 AS 39.35.760(d). An excess may not be used to purchase additional service credit in 07 the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. When a reemployed employee enters the 08 plan under AS 39.35.095(b), the administrator shall allow the employee to pay for a 09 period of service credit up to the employee's actual service. When an employee elects 10 to purchase service credit under this section and does not immediately pay for the 11 service credit purchased, an indebtedness is established. Interest as prescribed by 12 regulation accrues on an employee's indebtedness. If the indebtedness exists when the 13 employee is appointed to retirement, the administrator shall make a corresponding 14 actuarial adjustment to the benefit payable to the employee for service in the defined 15 contribution retirement plan. 16 (g) Actuarial assumptions about the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 17 must be based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan, except that the 18 retirement rates are computed at 25 percent of the retirement rates used in the most 19 recent actuarial valuation of the pension fund for the plan plus 75 percent of the 20 retirement rates used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan under 21 AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990. 22 (h) The provisions of this section are subject to the requirements of the 23 Internal Revenue Code and the limitations under AS 39.35.115, 39.35.678, 24 39.35.710(c) and (d), and 39.35.895.

[THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL 02 BE DEDUCTED BY THE EMPLOYER AT THE END OF EACH PAYROLL 03 PERIOD. THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE DEDUCTED FROM EMPLOYEE 04 COMPENSATION BEFORE COMPUTATION OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL 05 TAXES, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE TREATED AS EMPLOYER 06 CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE 07 THE OPTION OF MAKING THE PAYROLL DEDUCTION DIRECTLY INSTEAD 08 OF HAVING THE CONTRIBUTION PICKED UP BY THE EMPLOYER.] 09 * Sec. 62. AS 39.35.160 is amended by adding new subsections to read: 10 (e) An employee who first participates in the plan after June 30, 2006, shall 11 contribute to the plan an amount equal to eight percent of the employee's 12 compensation.

The contributions shall be deducted from 20 employee compensation before computation of applicable federal taxes, and the 21 contributions shall be treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A 22 member may not have the option of making the payroll deduction directly instead of 23 having the contribution picked up by the employer. 24 (g) The board may increase the employee contribution under (e) of this section 25 if the board determines that, unless the contribution is increased, the portion of the 26 liability of the plan that is attributable to employees who first participate in the plan 27 after June 30, 2006, will be funded below 90 percent. The board may not increase the 28 employee contribution unless the board increases the employer contribution under 29 AS 39.35.255(a)(2) by an equal amount. The board may decrease the contribution 30 under (e) of this section if the board determines that, after the contribution is 31 decreased, the portion of the liability of the plan that is attributable to all members 01 who first became members of the plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded above 90 02 percent. The board may not decrease the employee contribution unless the board 03 decreases the employer contribution under AS 39.35.255(a)(2) by an equal amount. 04 * Sec. 63.

An election made under 12 (a) of this section must be made in writing in the manner prescribed by the 13 administrator. An election made by a teacher who is married is not effective unless the 14 election is signed by the teacher's spouse. The administrator shall provide a teacher 15 who is eligible to make an election under (a) of this section with information about the 16 potential consequences of the teacher's election, including calculations to illustrate the 17 effect of moving the teacher's retirement plan from a defined contribution retirement 18 plan to a defined benefit retirement plan. 19 (c) An election made under (a) of this section to participate in the plan under 20 AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 is irrevocable.

On the effective 30 date of the teacher's participation in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220, the 31 teacher shall be credited with service in the plan. The board shall determine the cost of 01 the teacher's actual service time based on the teacher's accrued actuarial liability of 02 pension benefits in the plan, and credit the teacher with service time equal to the value 03 actuarially calculated and transferred to the retirement fund in the plan under 04 AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. The board shall adopt regulations establishing transfer 05 procedures. The transfer may not occur later than 60 days after the date the 06 administrator receives the teacher's election, unless the major financial markets for 07 securities available for a transfer are seriously disrupted by an unforeseen event that 08 also causes the suspension of trading on a national securities exchange in the country 09 where the securities were issued; in that event, the 60-day period may be extended by 10 a resolution of the board. A transfer is not commissionable or subject to a fee and may 11 be in the form of cash or a security as determined by the board. The value of a security 12 shall be assessed on the date the security is received in the teacher's account. 13 (e) When making a transfer under (d) of this section or a transfer for a 14 reemployed teacher subject to the plan under AS 14.25.040(h), the administrator shall 15 transfer 16 (1) an amount equal to the decrease in the accrued actuarial liability of 17 the death and disability trust in the plan established under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 18 resulting from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the most recent actuarial 19 valuation of the death and disability trust, from the death and disability trust in the 20 plan established under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 to the retirement fund in the plan 21 established under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220; and 22 (2) an amount equal to the increase in the accrued actuarial liability of 23 the health care trust in the plan established under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 resulting 24 from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the actuarial assumptions set out 25 in (g) of this section, from the trust established under AS 39.30.097(b) for the 26 prefunding of medical benefits provided by AS 14.25.480 to the trust established 27 under AS 39.30.097(a) for the prefunding of medical benefits provided by 28 AS 14.25.171. 29 (f) If the value actuarially calculated under (d) of this section is insufficient to 30 pay for service credit equal to the teacher's actual service time, the administrator shall 31 allow the teacher the option of purchasing service credit in an amount up to the 01 amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; however, if that value exceeds the 02 amount needed to pay for service credit equal to the teacher's actual service, the 03 administrator shall cause the excess to be paid to the employee as a rollover transfer 04 either to an individual employee annuity account in the Department of Administration 05 under the terms of AS 39.30.150 - 39.30.180 (State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity 06 Plan) or, if the member's employer does not participate in the State of Alaska 07 Supplemental Annuity Plan, to an eligible retirement plan as defined in 08 AS 14.25.360(d). An excess may not be used to purchase additional service credit in 09 the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. When a reemployed teacher enters the plan 10 under AS 14.25.040(h), the administrator shall allow the teacher to pay for a period of 11 service credit up to the teacher's actual service. When a teacher elects to purchase 12 service credit under this section and does not immediately pay for the service credit 13 purchased, an indebtedness is established. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues 14 on a teacher's indebtedness. If the indebtedness exists when the teacher is appointed to 15 retirement, the administrator shall make a corresponding actuarial adjustment to the 16 benefit payable to the teacher for service in the defined contribution retirement plan. 17 (g) Actuarial assumptions about the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 18 must be based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan, except that the 19 retirement rates are computed at 25 percent of the retirement rates used in the most 20 recent actuarial valuation of the retirement fund plus 75 percent of the retirement rates 21 used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590. 22 (h) The provisions of this section are subject to the requirements of the 23 Internal Revenue Code and the limitations under AS 14.25.010, 14.25.181, 24 14.25.320(c) and (d), and 14.25.490. 25 * Sec. 5.

A reemployed employee electing to participate under 07 (a) of this section shall use the balance of the employee's individual account in the 08 plan under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990, including any rollover contributions, to 09 purchase credited service in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. An election 10 made under (a) of this section must be made in writing in the manner prescribed by the 11 administrator. An election made by an employee who is married is not effective unless 12 the election is signed by the employee's spouse. The administrator shall provide an 13 employee who is eligible to make an election under (a) of this section with 14 information about the potential consequences of the employee's election, including 15 calculations to illustrate the effect of moving the employee's retirement plan from a 16 defined contribution retirement plan to a defined benefit retirement plan. 17 (c) An election made under (a) of this section to participate in the plan under 18 AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 is irrevocable. On the effective date of the election, an 19 eligible employee shall be enrolled as a member of the plan, and the employee's 20 participation in the plan shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the plan. 21 The employee's enrollment in the plan is retroactive to the date of hire. 22 (d) When an eligible employee makes an election under this section, the 23 administrator shall cause the total amount of the employee's employee and employer 24 contributions to the plan under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990, with investment earnings 25 and losses through the day of the employee's election to participate as a member in the 26 plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680, to be actuarially calculated and, subject to (f) of 27 this section, transferred to the pension fund in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 28 39.35.680. On the effective date of the employee's participation in the plan under 29 AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680, the employee shall be credited with service in the plan. The 30 board shall determine the cost of the employee's actual service time based on the 31 employee's accrued actuarial liability of pension benefits in the plan, and credit the 01 employee with service time equal to the value actuarially calculated and transferred to 02 the pension fund in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. The board shall adopt 03 regulations establishing transfer procedures. The transfer may not occur later than 60 04 days after the date the administrator receives the employee's election, unless the major 05 financial markets for securities available for a transfer are seriously disrupted by an 06 unforeseen event that also causes the suspension of trading on a national securities 07 exchange in the country where the securities were issued; in that event, the 60-day 08 period may be extended by a resolution of the board. A transfer is not commissionable 09 or subject to a fee and may be in the form of cash or a security as determined by the 10 board. The value of a security shall be assessed on the date the security is received in 11 the employee's account. 12 (e) When making a transfer under (d) of this section or a transfer for a 13 reemployed employee subject to the plan under AS 39.35.095(b), the administrator 14 shall transfer 15 (1) an amount equal to the decrease in the accrued actuarial liability of 16 the death and disability trust in the plan under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990 resulting 17 from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the most recent actuarial valuation 18 of the death and disability trust, from the death and disability trust in the plan under 19 AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990 to the pension fund in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 20 39.35.680; and 21 (2) an amount equal to the increase in the accrued actuarial liability of 22 the health care trust in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 resulting from the 23 transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the actuarial assumptions set out in (g) of 24 this section, from the trust established under AS 39.30.097(b) for the prefunding of 25 medical benefits provided by AS 39.35.880 to the trust established under 26 AS 39.30.097(a) for the prefunding of medical benefits provided by AS 39.35.537. 27 (f) If the value actuarially calculated under (d) of this section is insufficient to 28 pay for service credit equal to the employee's actual service, the administrator shall 29 allow the employee the option of purchasing service credit in an amount up to the 30 amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; however, if that value exceeds the 31 amount needed to pay for service credit equal to the employee's actual service, the 01 administrator shall cause the excess to be paid to the employee as a rollover transfer 02 either to an individual employee annuity account in the Department of Administration 03 under the terms of AS 39.30.150 - 39.30.180 (State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity 04 Plan) or, if the member's employer does not participate in the State of Alaska 05 Supplemental Annuity Plan, to an eligible retirement plan as defined in 06 AS 39.35.760(d). An excess may not be used to purchase additional service credit in 07 the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. When a reemployed employee enters the 08 plan under AS 39.35.095(b), the administrator shall allow the employee to pay for a 09 period of service credit up to the employee's actual service. When an employee elects 10 to purchase service credit under this section and does not immediately pay for the 11 service credit purchased, an indebtedness is established. Interest as prescribed by 12 regulation accrues on an employee's indebtedness. If the indebtedness exists when the 13 employee is appointed to retirement, the administrator shall make a corresponding 14 actuarial adjustment to the benefit payable to the employee for service in the defined 15 contribution retirement plan. 16 (g) Actuarial assumptions about the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 17 must be based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan, except that the 18 retirement rates are computed at 25 percent of the retirement rates used in the most 19 recent actuarial valuation of the pension fund for the plan plus 75 percent of the 20 retirement rates used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan under 21 AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990. 22 (h) The provisions of this section are subject to the requirements of the 23 Internal Revenue Code and the limitations under AS 39.35.115, 39.35.678, 24 39.35.710(c) and (d), and 39.35.895. In this subsection, "Internal Revenue Code" has 25 the meaning given in AS 39.35.990. 26 * Sec. 61. AS 39.35.160(a) is amended to read: 27 (a) Subject to (e) of this section, beginning [BEGINNING] January 1, 1987, 28 each peace officer or firefighter shall contribute to the plan an amount equal to seven 29 and one-half percent of the peace officer's or firefighter's compensation, and, except [. 30 EXCEPT] as provided in (d) - (e) [(d)] of this section, beginning January 1, 1987, 31 each other employee shall contribute to the plan an amount equal to six and three- 01 quarters percent of the employee's compensation. [THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL 02 BE DEDUCTED BY THE EMPLOYER AT THE END OF EACH PAYROLL 03 PERIOD. THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE DEDUCTED FROM EMPLOYEE 04 COMPENSATION BEFORE COMPUTATION OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL 05 TAXES, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE TREATED AS EMPLOYER 06 CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE 07 THE OPTION OF MAKING THE PAYROLL DEDUCTION DIRECTLY INSTEAD 08 OF HAVING THE CONTRIBUTION PICKED UP BY THE EMPLOYER.] 09 * Sec. 62. AS 39.35.160 is amended by adding new subsections to read: 10 (e) An employee who first participates in the plan after June 30, 2006, shall 11 contribute to the plan an amount equal to eight percent of the employee's 12 compensation. The board may, from time to time, adjust the employee contribution 13 under this subsection to an amount that, 14 (1) if decreased, is not less than eight percent of the employee's 15 compensation; and 16 (2) if increased, is not more than 12 percent of the employee's 17 compensation. 18 (f) Contributions under (a) and (e) of this section shall be deducted by the 19 employer at the end of each payroll period. The contributions shall be deducted from 20 employee compensation before computation of applicable federal taxes, and the 21 contributions shall be treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A 22 member may not have the option of making the payroll deduction directly instead of 23 having the contribution picked up by the employer. 24 (g) The board may increase the employee contribution under (e) of this section 25 if the board determines that, unless the contribution is increased, the portion of the 26 liability of the plan that is attributable to employees who first participate in the plan 27 after June 30, 2006, will be funded below 90 percent. The board may not increase the 28 employee contribution unless the board increases the employer contribution under 29 AS 39.35.255(a)(2) by an equal amount. The board may decrease the contribution 30 under (e) of this section if the board determines that, after the contribution is 31 decreased, the portion of the liability of the plan that is attributable to all members 01 who first became members of the plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded above 90 02 percent. The board may not decrease the employee contribution unless the board 03 decreases the employer contribution under AS 39.35.255(a)(2) by an equal amount. 04 * Sec. 63.
