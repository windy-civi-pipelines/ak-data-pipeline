AS 14.25 is amended by adding a new section to read: 20 Sec. 14.25.044. Election of defined benefit retirement plan by reemployed 21 teachers. (a) A teacher may make a one-time election to participate in the defined 22 benefit retirement plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 if the teacher 23 (1) became a member of the defined contribution retirement plan under 24 AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 after June 30, 2006, and before July 1, 2025; 25 (2) is not employed by an employer on July 1, 2025; 26 (3) is reemployed by an employer after July 1, 2025; and 27 (4) before the date of reemployment, 28 (A) has not received a distribution of the entire balance in the 29 teacher's individual account under the defined contribution retirement plan 30 under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590; or 31 (B) has received a rollover distribution of the entire balance in 01 the teacher's individual account in the plan under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 02 and has within 180 days of reemployment had all or part of a direct rollover 03 distribution from an eligible retirement plan owned by the teacher paid directly 04 into the teacher's individual account under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590. 05 (b) An election under (a) of this section may be made not more than 180 days 06 after the date of reemployment. A reemployed teacher electing to participate under (a) 07 of this section shall use the balance of the teacher's individual account in the plan 08 under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590, including any rollover contributions, to purchase 09 credited service in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. An election made under 10 (a) of this section must be made in writing in the manner prescribed by the 11 administrator. An election made by a teacher who is married is not effective unless the 12 election is signed by the teacher's spouse. The administrator shall provide a teacher 13 who is eligible to make an election under (a) of this section with information about the 14 potential consequences of the teacher's election, including calculations to illustrate the 15 effect of moving the teacher's retirement plan from a defined contribution retirement 16 plan to a defined benefit retirement plan. 17 (c) An election made under (a) of this section to participate in the plan under 18 AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 is irrevocable. On the effective date of the election, the 19 teacher shall be enrolled as a member of the plan, and the teacher's participation in the 20 plan shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the plan. The teacher's 21 enrollment in the plan is retroactive to the date of hire. 22 (d) When a teacher makes an election under this section to participate in the 23 plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220, the administrator shall cause the total amount of 24 the teacher's member and employer contributions to the plan under AS 14.25.310 - 25 14.25.590, with investment earnings and losses through the day of the teacher's 26 election to participate as a member in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220, to be 27 actuarially calculated and, subject to (f) of this section, transferred to the retirement 28 fund in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. On the effective date of the teacher's 29 participation in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220, the teacher shall be credited 30 with service in the plan. The board shall determine the cost of the teacher's actual 31 service time based on the teacher's accrued actuarial liability of pension benefits in the 01 plan, and credit the teacher with service time equal to the value actuarially calculated 02 and transferred to the retirement fund in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. The 03 board shall adopt regulations establishing transfer procedures. The transfer may not 04 occur later than 60 days after the date the administrator receives the teacher's election, 05 unless the major financial markets for securities available for a transfer are seriously 06 disrupted by an unforeseen event that also causes the suspension of trading on a 07 national securities exchange in the country where the securities were issued; in that 08 event, the 60-day period may be extended by a resolution of the board. A transfer is 09 not commissionable or subject to a fee and may be in the form of cash or a security as 10 determined by the board. The value of a security shall be assessed on the date the 11 security is received in the teacher's account. 12 (e) When making a transfer under (d) of this section or a transfer for a 13 reemployed teacher subject to the plan under AS 14.25.040(h), the administrator shall 14 transfer 15 (1) an amount equal to the decrease in the accrued actuarial liability of 16 the death and disability trust in the plan established under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 17 resulting from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the most recent actuarial 18 valuation of the death and disability trust, from the death and disability trust in the 19 plan established under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 to the retirement fund in the plan 20 established under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220; and 21 (2) an amount equal to the increase in the accrued actuarial liability of 22 the health care trust in the plan established under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 resulting 23 from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the actuarial assumptions set out 24 in (g) of this section, from the trust established under AS 39.30.097(b) for the 25 prefunding of medical benefits provided by AS 14.25.480 to the trust established 26 under AS 39.30.097(a) for the prefunding of medical benefits provided by 27 AS 14.25.171. 28 (f) If the value actuarially calculated under (d) of this section is insufficient to 29 pay for service credit equal to the teacher's actual service time, the administrator shall 30 allow the teacher the option of purchasing service credit in an amount up to the 31 amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; however, if that value exceeds the 01 amount needed to pay for service credit equal to the teacher's actual service, the 02 administrator shall cause the excess to be paid to the employee as a rollover transfer 03 either to an individual employee annuity account in the Department of Administration 04 under the terms of AS 39.30.150 - 39.30.180 (State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity 05 Plan) or, if the member's employer does not participate in the State of Alaska 06 Supplemental Annuity Plan, to an eligible retirement plan as defined in 07 AS 14.25.360(d). An excess may not be used to purchase additional service credit in 08 the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. When a reemployed teacher enters the plan 09 under AS 14.25.040(h), the administrator shall allow the teacher to pay for a period of 10 service credit up to the teacher's actual service. When a teacher elects to purchase 11 service credit under this section and does not immediately pay for the service credit 12 purchased, an indebtedness is established. Interest as prescribed by regulation accrues 13 on a teacher's indebtedness. If the indebtedness exists when the teacher is appointed to 14 retirement, the administrator shall make a corresponding actuarial adjustment to the 15 benefit payable to the teacher for service in the defined contribution retirement plan. 16 (g) Actuarial assumptions about the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 17 must be based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan, except that the 18 retirement rates are computed at 25 percent of the retirement rates used in the most 19 recent actuarial valuation of the retirement fund plus 75 percent of the retirement rates 20 used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590. 21 (h) The provisions of this section are subject to the requirements of the 22 Internal Revenue Code and the limitations under AS 14.25.010, 14.25.181, 23 14.25.320(c) and (d), and 14.25.490. 24 * Sec. 5. AS 14.25.048(b) is amended to read: 25 (b) An employee or former employee who first became a member of the 26 plan before July 1, 2006, may receive credit for retroactive membership service for 27 employment before June 5, 1988, if the employee or former employee met the 28 requirements listed in (a) of this section at the time of the employment. To receive 29 credit for the retroactive membership service, the employee or former employee shall 30 claim the service and pay the retroactive contributions required under former 31 AS 14.25.061. However, an employee or former employee may not receive retroactive 01 credit under this subsection if the employee received credited service under AS 39.35 02 for the employment. 03 * Sec. 6. AS 14.25.048(c) is amended to read: 04 (c) An employee or former employee who first became a member of the 05 plan before July 1, 2006, and who received credit under AS 39.35 for service that 06 qualifies under (a) of this section may elect to transfer those periods of employment to 07 the plan. To receive credit for retroactive membership service under this subsection, 08 the employee or former employee shall claim the service and pay the retroactive 09 contributions required under former AS 14.25.061. 10 * Sec. 7. AS 14.25.050(a) is amended to read: 11 (a) Except as provided in (c) and (e) of this section, beginning January 1, 12 1991, each member shall contribute to the plan an amount equal to 8.65 percent of the 13 member's base salary accrued from July 1 to the following June 30. [THE 14 EMPLOYER SHALL DEDUCT THE CONTRIBUTION FROM THE MEMBER'S 15 SALARY AT THE END OF EACH PAYROLL PERIOD, AND THE 16 CONTRIBUTION SHALL BE CREDITED BY THE PLAN TO THE MEMBER 17 CONTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE DEDUCTED 18 FROM EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BEFORE THE COMPUTATION OF 19 APPLICABLE FEDERAL TAXES AND SHALL BE TREATED AS EMPLOYER 20 CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE 21 THE OPTION OF MAKING THE PAYROLL DEDUCTION DIRECTLY IN CASH 22 INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CONTRIBUTION PICKED UP BY THE 23 EMPLOYER.] 24 * Sec. 8. AS 14.25.050 is amended by adding new subsections to read: 25 (e) A member who first participates in the plan after June 30, 2006, shall 26 contribute to the plan an amount equal to eight percent of the member's base salary 27 accrued from July 1 to the following June 30. The board may, from time to time, 28 adjust the contribution under this subsection to an amount that, 29 (1) if decreased, is not less than eight percent of the member's base 30 salary; and 31 (2) if increased, is not more than 12 percent of the member's base 01 salary. 02 (f) The employer shall deduct a contribution under this section from the 03 member's salary at the end of each payroll period, and the contribution shall be 04 credited by the plan to the member contribution account. The contributions shall be 05 deducted from member compensation before the computation of applicable federal 06 taxes and shall be treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A 07 member may not have the option of making the payroll deduction directly in cash 08 instead of having the contribution picked up by the employer. 09 (g) The board shall increase the member contribution under (e) of this section 10 if the board determines that, unless the contribution is increased, the portion of the 11 liability of the plan that is attributable to all members who first became members of 12 the plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded below 90 percent. The board may not 13 increase the member contribution unless the board increases the employer contribution 14 under AS 14.25.070(a)(2) by an equal amount. The board may decrease the 15 contribution under (e) of this section if the board determines that, after the 16 contribution is decreased, the portion of the liability of the plan that is attributable to 17 all members who first became members of the plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded 18 above 90 percent. The board may not decrease the member contribution unless the 19 board decreases the employer contribution under AS 14.25.070(a)(2) by an equal 20 amount. 21 * Sec. 9. AS 14.25.065(b) is amended to read: 22 (b) The contributions of employers under AS 14.25.070 must be transmitted to 23 the plan for deposit in the retirement fund and the Alaska retiree health care trust at the 24 close of each pay period. If the contributions are not submitted within the prescribed 25 time limit, interest must be assessed on the outstanding contributions at [ONE AND 26 ONE-HALF TIMES] the most recent actuarially determined rate of earnings for the 27 plan from the date that contributions were originally due. Amounts due from an 28 employer and interest as prescribed in this section may be claimed by the 29 administrator from any agency of the state or political subdivision that has in its 30 possession funds of the employer or that is authorized to disburse funds to the 31 employer that are not restricted by statute or appropriation to a specific purpose. The 01 amount claimed shall be certified by the administrator as sufficient to pay the 02 contributions and interest due from the employer. The amount claimed shall be 03 submitted to the administrator for deposit in the retirement fund and the Alaska retiree 04 health care trust. 05 * Sec. 10.

The value of a security 18 shall be assessed on the date the security is received in the employee's account. 19 (e) When making a transfer under (d) of this section or a transfer for a 20 reemployed employee subject to the plan under AS 39.35.095(b), the administrator 21 shall transfer 22 (1) an amount equal to the decrease in the accrued actuarial liability of 23 the death and disability trust in the plan under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990 resulting 24 from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the most recent actuarial valuation 25 of the death and disability trust, from the death and disability trust in the plan under 26 AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990 to the pension fund in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 27 39.35.680; and 28 (2) an amount equal to the increase in the accrued actuarial liability of 29 the health care trust in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 resulting from the 30 transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the actuarial assumptions set out in (g) of 31 this section, from the trust established under AS 39.30.097(b) for the prefunding of 01 medical benefits provided by AS 39.35.880 to the trust established under 02 AS 39.30.097(a) for the prefunding of medical benefits provided by AS 39.35.537. 03 (f) If the value actuarially calculated under (d) of this section is insufficient to 04 pay for service credit equal to the employee's actual service, the administrator shall 05 allow the employee the option of purchasing service credit in an amount up to the 06 amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; however, if that value exceeds the 07 amount needed to pay for service credit equal to the employee's actual service, the 08 administrator shall cause the excess to be paid to the employee as a rollover transfer 09 either to an individual employee annuity account in the Department of Administration 10 under the terms of AS 39.30.150 - 39.30.180 (State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity 11 Plan) or, if the member's employer does not participate in the State of Alaska 12 Supplemental Annuity Plan, to an eligible retirement plan as defined in 13 AS 39.35.760(d). An excess may not be used to purchase additional service credit in 14 the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. When a reemployed employee enters the 15 plan under AS 39.35.095(b), the administrator shall allow the employee to pay for a 16 period of service credit up to the employee's actual service. When an employee elects 17 to purchase service credit under this section and does not immediately pay for the 18 service credit purchased, an indebtedness is established. Interest as prescribed by 19 regulation accrues on an employee's indebtedness. If the indebtedness exists when the 20 employee is appointed to retirement, the administrator shall make a corresponding 21 actuarial adjustment to the benefit payable to the employee for service in the defined 22 contribution retirement plan. 23 (g) Actuarial assumptions about the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 24 must be based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan, except that the 25 retirement rates are computed at 25 percent of the retirement rates used in the most 26 recent actuarial valuation of the pension fund for the plan plus 75 percent of the 27 retirement rates used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan under 28 AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990. 29 (h) The provisions of this section are subject to the requirements of the 30 Internal Revenue Code and the limitations under AS 39.35.115, 39.35.678, 31 39.35.710(c) and (d), and 39.35.895.

[THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL 09 BE DEDUCTED BY THE EMPLOYER AT THE END OF EACH PAYROLL 10 PERIOD. THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE DEDUCTED FROM EMPLOYEE 11 COMPENSATION BEFORE COMPUTATION OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL 12 TAXES, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE TREATED AS EMPLOYER 13 CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE 14 THE OPTION OF MAKING THE PAYROLL DEDUCTION DIRECTLY INSTEAD 15 OF HAVING THE CONTRIBUTION PICKED UP BY THE EMPLOYER.] 16 * Sec. 63. AS 39.35.160 is amended by adding new subsections to read: 17 (e) An employee who first participates in the plan after June 30, 2006, shall 18 contribute to the plan an amount equal to eight percent of the employee's 19 compensation. The board may, from time to time, adjust the employee contribution 20 under this subsection to an amount that, 21 (1) if decreased, is not less than eight percent of the employee's 22 compensation; and 23 (2) if increased, is not more than 12 percent of the employee's 24 compensation. 25 (f) Contributions under (a) and (e) of this section shall be deducted by the 26 employer at the end of each payroll period. The contributions shall be deducted from 27 employee compensation before computation of applicable federal taxes, and the 28 contributions shall be treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A 29 member may not have the option of making the payroll deduction directly instead of 30 having the contribution picked up by the employer. 31 (g) The board shall increase the employee contribution under (e) of this 01 section if the board determines that, unless the contribution is increased, the portion of 02 the liability of the plan that is attributable to employees who first participate in the 03 plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded below 90 percent. The board may not increase 04 the employee contribution unless the board increases the employer contribution under 05 AS 39.35.255(a)(2) by an equal amount. The board may decrease the contribution 06 under (e) of this section if the board determines that, after the contribution is 07 decreased, the portion of the liability of the plan that is attributable to all members 08 who first became members of the plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded above 90 09 percent. The board may not decrease the employee contribution unless the board 10 decreases the employer contribution under AS 39.35.255(a)(2) by an equal amount. 11 * Sec. 64.

An election made by a teacher who is married is not effective unless the 12 election is signed by the teacher's spouse. The administrator shall provide a teacher 13 who is eligible to make an election under (a) of this section with information about the 14 potential consequences of the teacher's election, including calculations to illustrate the 15 effect of moving the teacher's retirement plan from a defined contribution retirement 16 plan to a defined benefit retirement plan. 17 (c) An election made under (a) of this section to participate in the plan under 18 AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 is irrevocable.

The board shall determine the cost of the teacher's actual 31 service time based on the teacher's accrued actuarial liability of pension benefits in the 01 plan, and credit the teacher with service time equal to the value actuarially calculated 02 and transferred to the retirement fund in the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. The 03 board shall adopt regulations establishing transfer procedures. The transfer may not 04 occur later than 60 days after the date the administrator receives the teacher's election, 05 unless the major financial markets for securities available for a transfer are seriously 06 disrupted by an unforeseen event that also causes the suspension of trading on a 07 national securities exchange in the country where the securities were issued; in that 08 event, the 60-day period may be extended by a resolution of the board. A transfer is 09 not commissionable or subject to a fee and may be in the form of cash or a security as 10 determined by the board. The value of a security shall be assessed on the date the 11 security is received in the teacher's account. 12 (e) When making a transfer under (d) of this section or a transfer for a 13 reemployed teacher subject to the plan under AS 14.25.040(h), the administrator shall 14 transfer 15 (1) an amount equal to the decrease in the accrued actuarial liability of 16 the death and disability trust in the plan established under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 17 resulting from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the most recent actuarial 18 valuation of the death and disability trust, from the death and disability trust in the 19 plan established under AS 14.25.310 - 14.25.590 to the retirement fund in the plan 20 established under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220; and 21 (2) an amount equal to the increase in the accrued actuarial liability of 22 the health care trust in the plan established under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220 resulting 23 from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the actuarial assumptions set out 24 in (g) of this section, from the trust established under AS 39.30.097(b) for the 25 prefunding of medical benefits provided by AS 14.25.480 to the trust established 26 under AS 39.30.097(a) for the prefunding of medical benefits provided by 27 AS 14.25.171. 28 (f) If the value actuarially calculated under (d) of this section is insufficient to 29 pay for service credit equal to the teacher's actual service time, the administrator shall 30 allow the teacher the option of purchasing service credit in an amount up to the 31 amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; however, if that value exceeds the 01 amount needed to pay for service credit equal to the teacher's actual service, the 02 administrator shall cause the excess to be paid to the employee as a rollover transfer 03 either to an individual employee annuity account in the Department of Administration 04 under the terms of AS 39.30.150 - 39.30.180 (State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity 05 Plan) or, if the member's employer does not participate in the State of Alaska 06 Supplemental Annuity Plan, to an eligible retirement plan as defined in 07 AS 14.25.360(d). An excess may not be used to purchase additional service credit in 08 the plan under AS 14.25.009 - 14.25.220. When a reemployed teacher enters the plan 09 under AS 14.25.040(h), the administrator shall allow the teacher to pay for a period of 10 service credit up to the teacher's actual service.

The benefits payable to those persons 65 27 years of age or older supplement any benefits provided under the federal old age, 28 survivors, and disability insurance program. 29 (k) The medical and optional insurance premiums owed by the person who 30 elects coverage may be deducted from the health reimbursement arrangement plan.

(a) An employee may make a one-time election to participate in the plan 01 under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 if the employee was first hired after June 30, 2006, 02 and before July 1, 2025, and, if not employed by an employer on July 1, 2025, is 03 reemployed by an employer after July 1, 2025, and, before the date of reemployment, 04 (1) has not received a distribution of the entire balance in the 05 employee's individual account under the defined contribution retirement plan 06 established in AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990; or 07 (2) has received a rollover distribution of the entire balance in the 08 member's individual account in the defined contribution retirement plan and has 09 within 180 days of reemployment had all or part of a direct rollover distribution from 10 an eligible retirement plan owned by the member paid directly into the member's 11 individual account. 12 (b) An election under (a) of this section may be made not more than 180 days 13 after the date of reemployment. A reemployed employee electing to participate under 14 (a) of this section shall use the balance of the employee's individual account in the 15 plan under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990, including any rollover contributions, to 16 purchase credited service in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. An election 17 made under (a) of this section must be made in writing in the manner prescribed by the 18 administrator. An election made by an employee who is married is not effective unless 19 the election is signed by the employee's spouse. The administrator shall provide an 20 employee who is eligible to make an election under (a) of this section with 21 information about the potential consequences of the employee's election, including 22 calculations to illustrate the effect of moving the employee's retirement plan from a 23 defined contribution retirement plan to a defined benefit retirement plan. 24 (c) An election made under (a) of this section to participate in the plan under 25 AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 is irrevocable. On the effective date of the election, an 26 eligible employee shall be enrolled as a member of the plan, and the employee's 27 participation in the plan shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the plan. 28 The employee's enrollment in the plan is retroactive to the date of hire. 29 (d) When an eligible employee makes an election under this section to 30 participate in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680, the administrator shall cause 31 the total amount of the employee's employee and employer contributions to the plan 01 under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990, with investment earnings and losses through the day 02 of the employee's election to participate as a member in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 03 39.35.680, to be actuarially calculated and, subject to (f) of this section, transferred to 04 the pension fund in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. On the effective date of 05 the employee's participation in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680, the employee 06 shall be credited with service in the plan. The board shall determine the cost of the 07 employee's actual service time based on the employee's accrued actuarial liability of 08 pension benefits in the plan, and credit the employee with service time equal to the 09 value actuarially calculated and transferred to the pension fund in the plan under 10 AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. The board shall adopt regulations establishing transfer 11 procedures. The transfer may not occur later than 60 days after the date the 12 administrator receives the employee's election, unless the major financial markets for 13 securities available for a transfer are seriously disrupted by an unforeseen event that 14 also causes the suspension of trading on a national securities exchange in the country 15 where the securities were issued; in that event, the 60-day period may be extended by 16 a resolution of the board. A transfer is not commissionable or subject to a fee and may 17 be in the form of cash or a security as determined by the board. The value of a security 18 shall be assessed on the date the security is received in the employee's account. 19 (e) When making a transfer under (d) of this section or a transfer for a 20 reemployed employee subject to the plan under AS 39.35.095(b), the administrator 21 shall transfer 22 (1) an amount equal to the decrease in the accrued actuarial liability of 23 the death and disability trust in the plan under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990 resulting 24 from the transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the most recent actuarial valuation 25 of the death and disability trust, from the death and disability trust in the plan under 26 AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990 to the pension fund in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 27 39.35.680; and 28 (2) an amount equal to the increase in the accrued actuarial liability of 29 the health care trust in the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 resulting from the 30 transfer as of the date of transfer, based on the actuarial assumptions set out in (g) of 31 this section, from the trust established under AS 39.30.097(b) for the prefunding of 01 medical benefits provided by AS 39.35.880 to the trust established under 02 AS 39.30.097(a) for the prefunding of medical benefits provided by AS 39.35.537. 03 (f) If the value actuarially calculated under (d) of this section is insufficient to 04 pay for service credit equal to the employee's actual service, the administrator shall 05 allow the employee the option of purchasing service credit in an amount up to the 06 amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; however, if that value exceeds the 07 amount needed to pay for service credit equal to the employee's actual service, the 08 administrator shall cause the excess to be paid to the employee as a rollover transfer 09 either to an individual employee annuity account in the Department of Administration 10 under the terms of AS 39.30.150 - 39.30.180 (State of Alaska Supplemental Annuity 11 Plan) or, if the member's employer does not participate in the State of Alaska 12 Supplemental Annuity Plan, to an eligible retirement plan as defined in 13 AS 39.35.760(d). An excess may not be used to purchase additional service credit in 14 the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680. When a reemployed employee enters the 15 plan under AS 39.35.095(b), the administrator shall allow the employee to pay for a 16 period of service credit up to the employee's actual service. When an employee elects 17 to purchase service credit under this section and does not immediately pay for the 18 service credit purchased, an indebtedness is established. Interest as prescribed by 19 regulation accrues on an employee's indebtedness. If the indebtedness exists when the 20 employee is appointed to retirement, the administrator shall make a corresponding 21 actuarial adjustment to the benefit payable to the employee for service in the defined 22 contribution retirement plan. 23 (g) Actuarial assumptions about the plan under AS 39.35.095 - 39.35.680 24 must be based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan, except that the 25 retirement rates are computed at 25 percent of the retirement rates used in the most 26 recent actuarial valuation of the pension fund for the plan plus 75 percent of the 27 retirement rates used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the plan under 28 AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990. 29 (h) The provisions of this section are subject to the requirements of the 30 Internal Revenue Code and the limitations under AS 39.35.115, 39.35.678, 31 39.35.710(c) and (d), and 39.35.895. In this subsection, "Internal Revenue Code" has 01 the meaning given in AS 39.35.990. 02 * Sec. 62. AS 39.35.160(a) is amended to read: 03 (a) Subject to (e) of this section, beginning [BEGINNING] January 1, 1987, 04 each peace officer or firefighter shall contribute to the plan an amount equal to seven 05 and one-half percent of the peace officer's or firefighter's compensation, and, except [. 06 EXCEPT] as provided in (d) - (e) [(d)] of this section, beginning January 1, 1987, 07 each other employee shall contribute to the plan an amount equal to six and three- 08 quarters percent of the employee's compensation. [THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL 09 BE DEDUCTED BY THE EMPLOYER AT THE END OF EACH PAYROLL 10 PERIOD. THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE DEDUCTED FROM EMPLOYEE 11 COMPENSATION BEFORE COMPUTATION OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL 12 TAXES, AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS SHALL BE TREATED AS EMPLOYER 13 CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A MEMBER MAY NOT HAVE 14 THE OPTION OF MAKING THE PAYROLL DEDUCTION DIRECTLY INSTEAD 15 OF HAVING THE CONTRIBUTION PICKED UP BY THE EMPLOYER.] 16 * Sec. 63. AS 39.35.160 is amended by adding new subsections to read: 17 (e) An employee who first participates in the plan after June 30, 2006, shall 18 contribute to the plan an amount equal to eight percent of the employee's 19 compensation. The board may, from time to time, adjust the employee contribution 20 under this subsection to an amount that, 21 (1) if decreased, is not less than eight percent of the employee's 22 compensation; and 23 (2) if increased, is not more than 12 percent of the employee's 24 compensation. 25 (f) Contributions under (a) and (e) of this section shall be deducted by the 26 employer at the end of each payroll period. The contributions shall be deducted from 27 employee compensation before computation of applicable federal taxes, and the 28 contributions shall be treated as employer contributions under 26 U.S.C. 414(h)(2). A 29 member may not have the option of making the payroll deduction directly instead of 30 having the contribution picked up by the employer. 31 (g) The board shall increase the employee contribution under (e) of this 01 section if the board determines that, unless the contribution is increased, the portion of 02 the liability of the plan that is attributable to employees who first participate in the 03 plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded below 90 percent. The board may not increase 04 the employee contribution unless the board increases the employer contribution under 05 AS 39.35.255(a)(2) by an equal amount. The board may decrease the contribution 06 under (e) of this section if the board determines that, after the contribution is 07 decreased, the portion of the liability of the plan that is attributable to all members 08 who first became members of the plan after June 30, 2006, will be funded above 90 09 percent. The board may not decrease the employee contribution unless the board 10 decreases the employer contribution under AS 39.35.255(a)(2) by an equal amount. 11 * Sec. 64.
