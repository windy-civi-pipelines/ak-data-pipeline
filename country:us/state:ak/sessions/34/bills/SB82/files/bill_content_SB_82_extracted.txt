28 (F) the method established in (E) of this paragraph is available 29 to a school district for the three fiscal years following the base fiscal year 30 determined under (E) of this paragraph only if the district's ADM adjusted for 31 school size determined under (A) of this paragraph for each fiscal year is less 01 than the district's ADM adjusted for school size in the base fiscal year; 02 (G) the method established in (E) of this paragraph does not 03 apply to a decrease in the district's ADM adjusted for school size resulting 04 from a loss of enrollment that occurs as a result of a boundary change under 05 AS 29;

29 (ii) for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the 30 district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) 31 of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's 01 ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 02 paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of 03 the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, 04 and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 05 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 06 adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's 07 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year, 08 multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 09 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, 10 multiplying that number by 66 percent, and adding that number to the 11 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current 12 fiscal year as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph; 13 (iii) for the fourth fiscal year after the base fiscal year, 14 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - 15 (C) of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's 16 ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 17 paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of 18 the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, 19 and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 20 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 21 adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's 22 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year, 23 multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 24 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, 25 multiplying that number by 33 percent, and adding that number to the 26 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current 27 fiscal year as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph; 28 (iv) to calculate the district's basic need for each fiscal 29 year, the number obtained through the calculation in (i), (ii), or (iii) of 30 this subparagraph is added to the number obtained under (C) of this 31 paragraph for the remainder of the district; 01 (I) if the basic need calculated under (H)(i) - (iii) of this 02 paragraph for one of the first four fiscal years after consolidation is less than 03 the basic need calculated under (A) - (C) of this paragraph for that fiscal year, 04 the basic need may not be adjusted under (H) of this paragraph for that fiscal 05 year; 06 (J) a district may not offset a decrease under (H) of this 07 paragraph if 08 (i) a new facility is constructed in the district for the 09 consolidation; or 10 (ii) the district offset a decrease under (E) of this 11 paragraph in the same fiscal year; 12 (K) a district that offsets a decrease under (H) of this paragraph 13 may not reopen a school that was closed for consolidation in the district until 14 (i) seven or more years have passed since the school 15 closure;

22 (M) a district offsetting a decrease under (H) of this paragraph 23 shall provide the department with the list of schools participating in the 24 consolidation and the corresponding ADM; 25 (2) the required local contribution of a city or borough school district is 26 the equivalent of a 2.65 mill tax levy on the full and true value of the taxable real and 27 personal property in the district as of January 1 of the second preceding fiscal year, as 28 determined by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic 29 Development under AS 14.17.510 and AS 29.45.110, not to exceed 45 percent of a 30 district's basic need for the preceding fiscal year as determined under (1) of this 31 subsection. 01 * Sec. 15.

basic need equals the sum 19 obtained under (D) of this paragraph, multiplied by the base student allocation set out 20 in AS 14.17.470; district adjusted ADM is calculated as follows: 21 (A) the ADM of each school in the district is calculated by 22 applying the school size factor to the student count as set out in AS 14.17.450; 23 (B) the number obtained under (A) of this paragraph is 24 multiplied by the district cost factor described in AS 14.17.460; 25 (C) the ADMs of each school in a district, as adjusted 26 according to (A) and (B) of this paragraph, are added to the number obtained 27 for correspondence study under AS 14.17.430;

05 (E) notwithstanding (A) - (C) of this paragraph, if a school 06 district's ADM adjusted for school size under (A) of this paragraph decreases 07 by five percent or more from one fiscal year to the next fiscal year, the school 08 district may use the last fiscal year before the decrease as a base fiscal year to 09 offset the decrease, according to the following method: 10 (i) for the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year 11 determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted 12 for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as 13 the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 75 percent of the 14 difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the 15 base fiscal year and the first fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 16 (ii) for the second fiscal year after the base fiscal year 17 determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted 18 for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as 19 the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 50 percent of the 20 difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the 21 base fiscal year and the second fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 22 (iii) for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year 23 determined under this subparagraph, the school district's ADM adjusted 24 for school size determined under (A) of this paragraph is calculated as 25 the district's ADM adjusted for school size, plus 25 percent of the 26 difference in the district's ADM adjusted for school size between the 27 base fiscal year and the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year; 28 (F) the method established in (E) of this paragraph is available 29 to a school district for the three fiscal years following the base fiscal year 30 determined under (E) of this paragraph only if the district's ADM adjusted for 31 school size determined under (A) of this paragraph for each fiscal year is less 01 than the district's ADM adjusted for school size in the base fiscal year; 02 (G) the method established in (E) of this paragraph does not 03 apply to a decrease in the district's ADM adjusted for school size resulting 04 from a loss of enrollment that occurs as a result of a boundary change under 05 AS 29; 06 (H) notwithstanding (A) - (C) of this paragraph, if one or more 07 schools close and consolidate with one or more other schools in the same 08 community and district and, as a result of the consolidation, basic need 09 generated by the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under 10 (A) - (C) of this paragraph decreases, the district may use the last fiscal year 11 before the consolidation as the base fiscal year to offset that decrease for the 12 first four fiscal years following consolidation according to the following 13 method: 14 (i) for the first two fiscal years after the base fiscal year, 15 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - 16 (C) of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's 17 ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 18 paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of 19 the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, 20 and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the district's ADM of 21 the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under 22 (A) - (C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's ADM of the 23 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, 24 multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 25 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, and 26 adding that number to the sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated 27 schools for the current fiscal year as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 28 paragraph; 29 (ii) for the third fiscal year after the base fiscal year, the 30 district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) 31 of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's 01 ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 02 paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of 03 the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, 04 and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 05 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 06 adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's 07 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year, 08 multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 09 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, 10 multiplying that number by 66 percent, and adding that number to the 11 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current 12 fiscal year as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph; 13 (iii) for the fourth fiscal year after the base fiscal year, 14 the district's ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - 15 (C) of this paragraph is calculated by dividing the sum of the district's 16 ADM of the consolidated schools as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this 17 paragraph for the base fiscal year by the sum of the district's ADM of 18 the consolidated schools for the base fiscal year without adjustment, 19 and subtracting the quotient obtained by dividing the sum of the 20 district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year as 21 adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph by the sum of the district's 22 ADM of the consolidated schools for the current fiscal year, 23 multiplying that number by the sum of the district's ADM of the 24 consolidated schools for the current fiscal year without adjustment, 25 multiplying that number by 33 percent, and adding that number to the 26 sum of the district's ADM of the consolidated schools for the current 27 fiscal year as adjusted under (A) - (C) of this paragraph; 28 (iv) to calculate the district's basic need for each fiscal 29 year, the number obtained through the calculation in (i), (ii), or (iii) of 30 this subparagraph is added to the number obtained under (C) of this 31 paragraph for the remainder of the district; 01 (I) if the basic need calculated under (H)(i) - (iii) of this 02 paragraph for one of the first four fiscal years after consolidation is less than 03 the basic need calculated under (A) - (C) of this paragraph for that fiscal year, 04 the basic need may not be adjusted under (H) of this paragraph for that fiscal 05 year; 06 (J) a district may not offset a decrease under (H) of this 07 paragraph if 08 (i) a new facility is constructed in the district for the 09 consolidation; or 10 (ii) the district offset a decrease under (E) of this 11 paragraph in the same fiscal year; 12 (K) a district that offsets a decrease under (H) of this paragraph 13 may not reopen a school that was closed for consolidation in the district until 14 (i) seven or more years have passed since the school 15 closure; and 16 (ii) the district provides evidence satisfactory to the 17 department that the schools affected by the consolidation are over 18 capacity; 19 (L) a district may not reopen and reconsolidate a school that 20 was consolidated in the district more than once every seven years for purposes 21 of the calculations made under (H) of this paragraph; 22 (M) a district offsetting a decrease under (H) of this paragraph 23 shall provide the department with the list of schools participating in the 24 consolidation and the corresponding ADM; 25 (2) the required local contribution of a city or borough school district is 26 the equivalent of a 2.65 mill tax levy on the full and true value of the taxable real and 27 personal property in the district as of January 1 of the second preceding fiscal year, as 28 determined by the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic 29 Development under AS 14.17.510 and AS 29.45.110, not to exceed 45 percent of a 30 district's basic need for the preceding fiscal year as determined under (1) of this 31 subsection. 01 * Sec. 15. AS 14.17.420(a) is amended to read: 02 (a) As a component of public school funding, a district is eligible for special 03 needs and secondary school vocational and technical instruction funding and may be 04 eligible for intensive services funding as follows: 05 (1) special needs funding is available to a district to assist the district 06 in providing special education, gifted and talented education, vocational education, 07 and bilingual education services to its students; a special needs funding factor of 1.20 08 shall be applied as set out in AS 14.17.410(b)(1); 09 (2) in addition to the special needs funding for which a district is 10 eligible under (1) of this subsection, a district is eligible for intensive services funding 11 for each special education student who needs and receives intensive services and is 12 enrolled on the last day of the count period; for each such student, intensive services 13 funding is equal to the intensive student count multiplied by 13; 14 (3) in addition to the special needs and intensive services funding 15 available under (1) and (2) of this subsection, secondary school vocational and 16 technical instruction funding is available to assist districts in providing vocational and 17 technical instruction to students who are enrolled in a secondary school; a secondary 18 school vocational and technical instruction funding factor of 1.04 [1.015] shall be 19 applied as set out in AS 14.17.410(b)(1); in this paragraph, "vocational and technical 20 instruction" excludes costs associated with 21 (A) administrative expenses; and 22 (B) instruction in general literacy, mathematics, and job 23 readiness skills. 24 * Sec. 16.
