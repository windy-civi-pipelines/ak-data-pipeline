Attempting to obtain the 26 consent of the minor's parent or guardian would be detrimental to the minor's well- 27 being if 28 (1) the behavioral or mental health services are related to allegations of 29 neglect, sexual abuse, or mental or physical abuse by the minor's parent or guardian; 30 or 31 (2) the mental health provider finds that 01 (A) requiring the consent of the minor's parent or guardian 02 would cause the minor to reject behavioral or mental health services; 03 (B) failing to provide behavioral or mental health services to 04 the minor would be detrimental to the minor's well-being; 05 (C) the minor sought behavioral or mental health services 06 knowingly and voluntarily; and 07 (D) the minor has the maturity to productively participate in 08 behavioral or mental health services. 09 (c) If the mental health provider determines that attempting to obtain the 10 consent of the minor's parent or guardian would not be detrimental to the minor's well- 11 being, the mental health provider shall inform the minor that the consent of the minor's 12 parent or guardian is required to continue providing behavioral or mental health 13 services to the minor. The mental health provider shall discontinue behavioral or 14 mental health services to a minor who does not permit the mental health provider to 15 obtain the consent of the minor's parent or guardian and notify the minor's parent or 16 guardian that the services were provided. If the minor permits the mental health 17 provider to obtain the consent of the minor's parent or guardian, the mental health 18 provider shall make reasonable attempts to obtain that consent. The mental health 19 provider shall document each attempt to obtain consent in the minor's clinical record. 20 The mental health provider may continue to provide behavioral or mental health 21 services to the minor without the consent of the minor's parent or guardian if 22 (1) the mental health provider has made at least two unsuccessful 23 attempts to contact the minor's parent or guardian to obtain consent by mail, electronic 24 mail, or telephone; and 25 (2) the mental health provider has the written consent of the minor. 26 (d) If the mental health provider determines that attempting to obtain the 27 consent of the minor's parent or guardian would be detrimental to the minor's well- 28 being, the mental health provider shall document the basis for the determination in the 29 minor's clinical record. The mental health provider may continue to provide behavioral 30 or mental health services to the minor upon the minor's written consent. The mental 31 health provider and the mental health provider's supervisor, if the mental health 01 provider has a supervisor, shall evaluate the determination made under (b) of this 02 section every 60 days until either the mental health provider discontinues providing 03 services to the minor or the minor turns 18 years of age. 04 (e) A mental health provider may not inform the parent or guardian of a minor 05 receiving behavioral or mental health services under (d) of this section of those 06 services without the written consent of the minor. A mental health provider shall 07 inform a minor before disclosing to the minor's parent or guardian information 08 regarding any behavioral or mental health services provided to the minor. The mental 09 health provider may not disclose the information to the parent or guardian if the minor 10 discontinues the behavioral or mental health services upon being informed of the 11 mental health provider's intent. A mental health provider may deny a minor's parent or 12 guardian access to any part of the minor's clinical record if the mental health provider 13 has compelling reasons for the denial. 14 (f) The parent or guardian of a minor is relieved of all financial obligation to 15 the provider of a service under this section. 16 (g) Nothing in this section may be construed to remove liability of the person 17 performing the examination or treatment for failure to meet the standards of care 18 common throughout the health professions in the state or for intentional misconduct. 19 (h) In this section, "mental health provider" means a behavioral health 20 professional as defined in AS 14.30.174(b) and a mental health professional as defined 21 in AS 47.30.915. 22 * Sec. 5.

The court may authorize the department to continue the placement of 14 the child in a [SECURE] residential psychiatric treatment center if the court finds, 15 based on the testimony of a mental health professional, that the conditions or 16 symptoms that resulted in the initial order have not ameliorated to such an extent that 17 the child's needs can be met in a less restrictive setting and that the child's mental 18 condition could be improved by the course of treatment or would deteriorate if 19 untreated. 20 (c) The department shall transfer a child from a [SECURE] residential 21 psychiatric treatment center to another appropriate placement if the mental health 22 professional responsible for the child's treatment determines that the child would no 23 longer benefit from the course of treatment or that the child's treatment needs could be 24 met in a less restrictive setting.

The court may authorize the 23 department to continue the placement of the child in a hospital if the court finds by 24 clear and convincing evidence, based on the testimony of a mental health professional, 25 and taking into account the length of time the child has been in the hospital, that the 26 conditions or symptoms that resulted in the initial placement made under (a) of this 27 section have not ameliorated to the extent that the child's needs can be met in a less 28 restrictive setting, and that the child's mental condition could be improved by the 29 course of treatment or would deteriorate if untreated. If a court does not make the 30 findings required under this subsection, the child shall be released from the hospital 31 for placement in a less restrictive setting. The court may vacate a hearing scheduled as 01 required under this subsection if either 02 (1) the child is released to a less restrictive setting before the scheduled 03 hearing; or 04 (2) all parties agree that the initial placement under (a) of this section 05 was reasonable and necessary, the parties submit to the court a written stipulation that 06 includes a treatment plan and timeline that will result in releasing the child to a less 07 restrictive setting, and the court finds in writing that the treatment plan and timeline 08 are reasonable and will result in releasing the child to a less restrictive setting. 09 (d) The court shall review a placement approved under (c) of this section 10 (1) at least once every 30 days; and 11 (2) when requested by the child, the child's parent or guardian, the 12 child's guardian ad litem, or any other party, upon a showing of good cause. 13 * Sec. 9.

If the minor permits the mental health 17 provider to obtain the consent of the minor's parent or guardian, the mental health 18 provider shall make reasonable attempts to obtain that consent. The mental health 19 provider shall document each attempt to obtain consent in the minor's clinical record. 20 The mental health provider may continue to provide behavioral or mental health 21 services to the minor without the consent of the minor's parent or guardian if 22 (1) the mental health provider has made at least two unsuccessful 23 attempts to contact the minor's parent or guardian to obtain consent by mail, electronic 24 mail, or telephone; and 25 (2) the mental health provider has the written consent of the minor. 26 (d) If the mental health provider determines that attempting to obtain the 27 consent of the minor's parent or guardian would be detrimental to the minor's well- 28 being, the mental health provider shall document the basis for the determination in the 29 minor's clinical record.

A mental health provider shall 07 inform a minor before disclosing to the minor's parent or guardian information 08 regarding any behavioral or mental health services provided to the minor. The mental 09 health provider may not disclose the information to the parent or guardian if the minor 10 discontinues the behavioral or mental health services upon being informed of the 11 mental health provider's intent. A mental health provider may deny a minor's parent or 12 guardian access to any part of the minor's clinical record if the mental health provider 13 has compelling reasons for the denial. 14 (f) The parent or guardian of a minor is relieved of all financial obligation to 15 the provider of a service under this section. 16 (g) Nothing in this section may be construed to remove liability of the person 17 performing the examination or treatment for failure to meet the standards of care 18 common throughout the health professions in the state or for intentional misconduct. 19 (h) In this section, "mental health provider" means a behavioral health 20 professional as defined in AS 14.30.174(b) and a mental health professional as defined 21 in AS 47.30.915. 22 * Sec. 5.

The court may authorize the department to continue the placement of 14 the child in a [SECURE] residential psychiatric treatment center if the court finds, 15 based on the testimony of a mental health professional, that the conditions or 16 symptoms that resulted in the initial order have not ameliorated to such an extent that 17 the child's needs can be met in a less restrictive setting and that the child's mental 18 condition could be improved by the course of treatment or would deteriorate if 19 untreated. 20 (c) The department shall transfer a child from a [SECURE] residential 21 psychiatric treatment center to another appropriate placement if the mental health 22 professional responsible for the child's treatment determines that the child would no 23 longer benefit from the course of treatment or that the child's treatment needs could be 24 met in a less restrictive setting.

If a court does not make the 30 findings required under this subsection, the child shall be released from the hospital 31 for placement in a less restrictive setting. The court may vacate a hearing scheduled as 01 required under this subsection if either 02 (1) the child is released to a less restrictive setting before the scheduled 03 hearing; or 04 (2) all parties agree that the initial placement under (a) of this section 05 was reasonable and necessary, the parties submit to the court a written stipulation that 06 includes a treatment plan and timeline that will result in releasing the child to a less 07 restrictive setting, and the court finds in writing that the treatment plan and timeline 08 are reasonable and will result in releasing the child to a less restrictive setting. 09 (d) The court shall review a placement approved under (c) of this section 10 (1) at least once every 30 days; and 11 (2) when requested by the child, the child's parent or guardian, the 12 child's guardian ad litem, or any other party, upon a showing of good cause. 13 * Sec. 9.
