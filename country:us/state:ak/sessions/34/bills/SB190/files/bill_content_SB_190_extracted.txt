A person not otherwise entitled to 28 access court records under this subsection for good cause may petition the court for 29 access to court records of the guardianship, including the report and plan of the 30 guardian.

Who may be guardian for adult; order of priority. (a) 15 Except as otherwise provided in (c) of this section, the court in appointing a guardian 16 for an adult shall consider persons qualified to be guardian in the following order of 17 priority: 18 (1) a guardian, other than a temporary or emergency guardian, 19 currently acting for the respondent in another jurisdiction; 20 (2) a person nominated as guardian by the respondent, including the 21 respondent's most recent nomination made in a power of attorney under AS 13.26; 22 (3) an agent appointed by the respondent under a durable power of 23 attorney for health care under AS 13.52; 24 (4) a spouse of the respondent; 25 (5) a family member or other individual who has shown special care 26 and concern for the respondent; 27 (6) a private professional guardian; and 28 (7) the public guardian. 29 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under (a) of this section, the 30 court shall select as guardian the person the court considers best qualified. In 31 determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider the relationship of the 01 person with the respondent, the skills of the person, the expressed wishes of the 02 respondent, the extent to which the person and the respondent have similar values and 03 preferences, and the likelihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a 04 guardian successfully. 05 (c) If it is in the best interest of the respondent, the court may decline to 06 appoint as guardian a person having priority under (a) of this section and appoint a 07 person having a lower priority or no priority. 08 (d) A person that provides paid services to the respondent, or an individual 09 who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the respondent or is the 10 spouse, parent, or child of an individual who provides or is employed to provide paid 11 services to the respondent, may not be appointed as guardian unless 12 (1) the individual is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or 13 adoption; or 14 (2) the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is 15 the best qualified person available for appointment and the appointment is in the best 16 interest of the respondent. 17 (e) An owner, operator, or employee of a long-term care facility at which the 18 respondent is receiving care may not be appointed as guardian unless the owner, 19 operator, or employee is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption. 20 Sec. 13.29.105. Order of appointment for guardian. (a) A court order 21 appointing a guardian for an adult must 22 (1) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence 23 established that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a protective 24 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative, including use 25 of appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision 26 making; 27 (2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence 28 established that the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the petition; 29 (3) state whether the adult subject to guardianship retains the right to 30 vote and, if the adult does not retain the right to vote, include findings that support 31 removing that right, which must include a finding that the adult cannot communicate, 01 with or without support, a specific desire to participate in the voting process; and 02 (4) state whether the adult subject to guardianship retains the right to 03 marry and, if the adult does not retain the right to marry, include findings that support 04 removing that right. 05 (b) An adult subject to guardianship retains the right to vote unless the order 06 under (a) of this section includes the statement required under (a)(3) of this section. 07 An adult subject to guardianship retains the right to marry unless the order under (a) of 08 this section includes the findings required under (a)(4) of this section. 09 (c) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult must state the 10 basis for granting a full guardianship and include specific findings that support the 11 conclusion that a limited guardianship would not meet the functional needs of the 12 adult subject to guardianship. 13 (d) A court order establishing a limited guardianship for an adult must state 14 the specific powers granted to the guardian. 15 (e) The court, as part of an order establishing a guardianship for an adult, shall 16 identify any person that is entitled to 17 (1) notice of the rights of the adult under AS 13.29.110(b); 18 (2) notice of a change in the primary dwelling of the adult; 19 (3) notice that the guardian has delegated 20 (A) the power to manage the care of the adult; 21 (B) the power to make decisions about where the adult lives; 22 (C) the power to make major medical decisions on behalf of the 23 adult; 24 (D) a power that requires court approval under AS 13.29.130; 25 or 26 (E) substantially all powers of the guardian; 27 (4) notice that the guardian will be unavailable to visit the adult for 28 more than two months or unavailable to perform the guardian's duties for more than 29 one month; 30 (5) a copy of the plan of the guardian under AS 13.29.135 and the 31 report of the guardian under AS 13.29.140; 01 (6) access to court records relating to the guardianship; 02 (7) notice of the death or significant change in the condition of the 03 adult; 04 (8) notice that the court has limited or modified the powers of the 05 guardian; and 06 (9) notice of the removal of the guardian. 07 (f) A spouse and adult children of an adult subject to guardianship are entitled 08 to notice under (e) of this section unless the court determines notice would be contrary 09 to the preferences or prior directions of the adult subject to guardianship or not in the 10 best interest of the adult. 11 Sec. 13.29.110. Notice of order of appointment; rights. (a) A guardian 12 appointed under AS 13.29.060 shall give the adult subject to guardianship and all 13 other persons given notice under AS 13.29.070 a copy of the order of appointment, 14 together with notice of the right to request termination or modification. The order and 15 notice must be given not later than 14 days after the appointment. 16 (b) Not later than 30 days after appointment of a guardian under 17 AS 13.29.060, the court shall give to the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, 18 and any other person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order a 19 statement of the rights of the adult subject to guardianship and procedures to seek 20 relief if the adult is denied those rights. The statement must be in at least 16-point font, 21 in plain language, and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the adult subject 22 to guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify the adult subject to 23 guardianship of the right to 24 (1) seek termination or modification of the guardianship or removal of 25 the guardian, and choose an attorney to represent the adult in these matters; 26 (2) be involved in decisions affecting the adult, including decisions 27 about the adult's care, dwelling, activities, or social interactions, to the extent 28 reasonably feasible; 29 (3) be involved in health care decision making to the extent reasonably 30 feasible; 31 (4) be supported in understanding the risks and benefits of health care 01 options to the extent reasonably feasible; 02 (5) be notified at least 14 days before a change in the adult's primary 03 dwelling or permanent move to a nursing home, mental health facility, or other facility 04 that places restrictions on the individual's ability to leave or have visitors unless the 05 change or move is proposed in the plan of the guardian under AS 13.29.135 or 06 authorized by the court by specific order; 07 (6) object to a change or move described in (5) of this subsection and 08 the process for objecting; 09 (7) communicate, visit, or interact with others, including receiving 10 visitors, and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail, or electronic 11 communications, including through social media, unless 12 (A) the guardian has been authorized by the court by specific 13 order to restrict communications, visits, or interactions; 14 (B) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of 15 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person; or 16 (C) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is 17 necessary because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant 18 physical, psychological, or financial harm to the adult, and the restriction is 19 (i) for a period of not more than seven business days if 20 the person has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the 21 adult; or 22 (ii) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person 23 does not have a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; 24 (8) receive a copy of the plan of the guardian under AS 13.29.135 and 25 the report of the guardian under AS 13.29.140; and 26 (9) object to the plan or report of the guardian. 27 Sec. 13.29.115. Emergency guardian for adult. (a) On its own after a petition 28 has been filed under AS 13.29.065, or on petition by a person interested in an adult's 29 welfare, the court may appoint an emergency guardian for the adult if the court finds 30 (1) appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent 31 substantial harm to the adult's physical health, safety, or welfare; 01 (2) no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in 02 the circumstances; and 03 (3) there is reason to believe that a basis for appointment of a guardian 04 under AS 13.29.060 exists. 05 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an adult may not 06 exceed 60 days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only the powers specified 07 in the order of appointment. The authority of the emergency guardian may be 08 extended once for not more than 60 days if the court finds that the conditions for 09 appointment of an emergency guardian under (a) of this section continue. 10 (c) Immediately on filing of a petition for appointment of an emergency 11 guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in 12 the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in (d) of this section, reasonable notice 13 of the date, time, and place of a hearing on the petition must be given to the 14 respondent, the respondent's attorney, and any other person the court determines. 15 (d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult without notice 16 to the adult and any attorney for the adult only if the court finds from an affidavit or 17 testimony that the respondent's physical health, safety, or welfare will be substantially 18 harmed before a hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court 19 appoints an emergency guardian without giving notice under (c) of this section, the 20 court must 21 (1) give notice of the appointment, not later than 48 hours after the 22 appointment, to 23 (A) the respondent; 24 (B) the respondent's attorney; and 25 (C) any other person the court determines; and 26 (2) hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not later 27 than five days after the appointment. 28 (e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is not a 29 determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under AS 13.29.060. 30 (f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this section 31 at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court requires. 01 Sec. 13.29.120. Duties of guardian for adult. (a) A guardian for an adult is a 02 fiduciary. Except as otherwise limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make 03 decisions regarding the support, care, education, health, and welfare of the adult 04 subject to guardianship to the extent necessitated by the limitations of the adult. 05 (b) A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of the adult 06 and, to the extent reasonably feasible, encourage the adult to participate in decisions, 07 act on the adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the adult's 08 personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall 09 (1) become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and 10 maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular visitation, to 11 know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities, and physical and mental 12 health; 13 (2) to the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and 14 preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the adult, 15 including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities, or social interactions; 16 and 17 (3) make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive 18 relationships and services for the adult. 19 (c) A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable care, 20 diligence, and prudence when acting on behalf of or making decisions for the adult. In 21 furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall 22 (1) take reasonable care of the personal effects, pets, and service or 23 support animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a conservatorship or protective 24 arrangement instead of conservatorship if necessary to protect the property of the 25 adult; 26 (2) expend funds and other property of the adult received by the 27 guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education, health, and welfare; 28 (3) conserve any funds and other property of the adult not expended 29 under (2) of this subsection for the future needs of the adult, but if a conservator has 30 been appointed for the adult, the guardian shall pay the funds and other property at 31 least quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the future needs of the adult; and 01 (4) monitor the quality of services, including long-term care services, 02 provided to the adult. 03 (d) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the guardian 04 shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the adult would make if the 05 adult were able unless doing so would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or 06 personal or financial interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject 07 to guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's previous or 08 current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actually 09 known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. 10 (e) If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under (d) of this section 11 because the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine the decision the 12 adult likely would make if able, or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the 13 adult would make would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or 14 financial interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with the best 15 interest of the adult. In determining the best interest of the adult, the guardian shall 16 consider 17 (1) information received from professionals and persons that 18 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult; 19 (2) other information the guardian believes the adult would have 20 considered if the adult were able to act; and 21 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult 22 would consider, including consequences for others. 23 (f) A guardian for an adult shall immediately notify the court if the condition 24 of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising rights previously 25 removed. 26 Sec. 13.29.125. Powers of guardian for adult. (a) Except as limited by court 27 order, a guardian for an adult may 28 (1) apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the 29 adult, unless a conservator is appointed for the adult and the application or receipt is 30 within the powers of the conservator; 31 (2) unless inconsistent with a court order, establish the adult's place of 01 dwelling; 02 (3) consent to health or other care, treatment, or service for the adult; 03 (4) if a conservator for the adult has not been appointed, commence a 04 proceeding, including an administrative proceeding, or take other appropriate action to 05 compel another person to support the adult or pay funds for the benefit of the adult; 06 (5) to the extent reasonable, delegate to the adult responsibility for a 07 decision affecting the adult's well-being; and 08 (6) receive personally identifiable health care information regarding 09 the adult. 10 (b) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult to 11 consent to the adoption of the adult. In determining whether to authorize a power 12 under this subsection, the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be in 13 accordance with the preferences, values, and prior directions of the adult and whether 14 the underlying act would be in the best interest of the adult. 15 (c) In exercising a guardian's power to establish the place of dwelling of the 16 adult under (a)(2) of this section, the guardian shall 17 (1) select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult would 18 select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-making standard under 19 AS 13.29.120(d) and (e); if the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably 20 determine what setting the adult subject to guardianship would likely choose if able, or 21 the guardian reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would 22 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the 23 adult, the guardian shall choose a residential setting that is consistent with the best 24 interest of the adult in accordance with AS 13.29.120(e); 25 (2) in selecting among residential settings, give priority to a residential 26 setting in a location that will allow the adult to interact with persons important to the 27 adult and meet the needs of the adult in the least restrictive manner reasonably feasible 28 unless to do so would be inconsistent with the decision-making standard in 29 AS 13.29.120(d) and (e); 30 (3) not later than 30 days after a change in the dwelling of the adult, 31 (A) give notice of the change to the court, the adult, and any 01 person identified as entitled to the notice in the court order appointing the 02 guardian or a subsequent order; and 03 (B) include in the notice the address and nature of the new 04 dwelling and state whether the adult received advance notice of the change and 05 whether the adult objected to the change; 06 (4) establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult to a 07 nursing home, mental health facility, or other facility that places restrictions on the 08 adult's ability to leave or have visitors only if 09 (A) the establishment or move is in the plan of the guardian 10 under AS 13.29.135; 11 (B) the court authorizes the establishment or move; or 12 (C) the guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at 13 least 14 days before the establishment or move to the adult and all persons 14 entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e)(2) or a subsequent order, and no 15 objection is filed; 16 (5) establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult outside this 17 state only if consistent with the plan of the guardian and authorized by the court by 18 specific order; and 19 (6) take action that would result in the sale of the primary dwelling or 20 surrender of the rental agreement or lease to the primary dwelling of the adult only if 21 (A) the action is specifically included in the plan of the 22 guardian under AS 13.29.135; 23 (B) the court authorizes the action by specific order; or 24 (C) notice of the action was given at least 14 days before the 25 action to the adult and all persons entitled to the notice under 26 AS 13.29.105(e)(2) or a subsequent order and no objection has been filed. 27 (d) In exercising a guardian's power under (a)(3) of this section to make health 28 care decisions, the guardian shall 29 (1) involve the adult in decision making to the extent reasonably 30 feasible, including, when practicable, by encouraging and supporting the adult in 31 understanding the risks and benefits of health care options; 01 (2) defer to a decision by an agent under a durable power of attorney 02 for health care executed under AS 13.52 by the adult and cooperate to the extent 03 feasible with the agent making the decision; and 04 (3) take into account 05 (A) the risks and benefits of treatment options; and 06 (B) the current and previous wishes and values of the adult if 07 known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. 08 Sec. 13.29.130. Special limitations on guardian's power. (a) Unless 09 authorized by the court by specific order, a guardian for an adult does not have the 10 power to revoke or amend a durable power of attorney for health care under AS 13.52 11 or durable power of attorney under AS 13.26 executed by the adult. If a durable power 12 of attorney for health care under AS 13.52 is in effect, unless there is a court order to 13 the contrary, a health care decision of an agent takes precedence over that of the 14 guardian, and the guardian shall cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible. If a 15 durable power of attorney under AS 13.26 is in effect, unless there is a court order to 16 the contrary, a decision by the agent that the agent is authorized to make under the 17 power of attorney takes precedence over that of the guardian, and the guardian shall 18 cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible. 19 (b) A guardian for an adult may not initiate the commitment of the adult to a 20 mental health facility except in accordance with the procedure for involuntary 21 commitment under AS 47.30. 22 (c) A guardian for an adult may not restrict the ability of the adult to 23 communicate, visit, or interact with others, including receiving visitors and making or 24 receiving telephone calls, personal mail, or electronic communications, including 25 through social media, or participating in social activities, unless 26 (1) authorized by the court by specific order; 27 (2) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of 28 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person; or 29 (3) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary 30 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant physical, 31 psychological, or financial harm to the adult and the restriction is for a period of not 01 more than 02 (A) seven business days if the person has a family or pre- 03 existing social relationship with the adult; or 04 (B) 60 days if the person does not have a family or pre-existing 05 social relationship with the adult. 06 (d) A guardian for an adult may not prohibit the marriage or divorce of the 07 adult if the adult retains the right to marry under AS 13.29.105. 08 Sec. 13.29.135. Guardian's plan. (a) A guardian for an adult shall file with 09 the court a plan for the care of the adult not later than 60 days after appointment, when 10 there is a significant change in circumstances, or when the guardian seeks to deviate 11 significantly from the guardian's plan. The plan must be based on the needs of the 12 adult and take into account the best interest of the adult as well as the adult's 13 preferences, values, and prior directions, to the extent known to or reasonably 14 ascertainable by the guardian. The guardian shall include in the plan 15 (1) the living arrangement, services, and supports the guardian expects 16 to arrange, facilitate, or continue for the adult; 17 (2) social and educational activities the guardian expects to facilitate 18 on behalf of the adult; 19 (3) any person with whom the adult has a close personal relationship or 20 relationship involving regular visitation and any plan the guardian has for facilitating 21 visits with the person; 22 (4) the anticipated nature and frequency of the guardian's visits and 23 communication with the adult; 24 (5) goals for the adult, including goals related to the restoration of the 25 rights of the adult and how the guardian anticipates achieving the goals; 26 (6) whether the adult has an existing plan and, if so, whether the plan 27 of the guardian is consistent with the plan of the adult; and 28 (7) a statement or list of the amount the guardian proposes to charge 29 for each service the guardian anticipates providing to the adult. 30 (b) A guardian shall give notice of the filing of the guardian's plan under (a) of 31 this section, together with a copy of the plan, to the adult subject to guardianship, a 01 person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order, and any other 02 person the court determines. The notice must include a statement of the right to object 03 to the plan and be given not later than 14 days after the filing. 04 (c) An adult subject to guardianship and any person entitled under (b) of this 05 section to receive notice and a copy of the plan of the guardian may object to the plan. 06 (d) The court shall review the plan of the guardian filed under (a) of this 07 section and determine whether to approve the plan or require a new plan. In deciding 08 whether to approve the plan, the court shall consider an objection under (c) of this 09 section and whether the plan is consistent with the guardian's duties and powers under 10 AS 13.29.120 and 13.29.125. The court may not approve the plan until 30 days after 11 its filing. 12 (e) After the plan of the guardian filed under this section is approved by the 13 court, the guardian shall provide a copy of the plan to the adult subject to 14 guardianship, a person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order, 15 and any other person the court determines. 16 Sec. 13.29.140. Guardian's report; monitoring of guardianship. (a) A 17 guardian for an adult, not later than 60 days after appointment and at least annually 18 thereafter, shall file with the court a report in a record regarding the condition of the 19 adult and accounting for funds and other property in the possession or subject to the 20 control of the guardian. 21 (b) A report under (a) of this section must state or contain 22 (1) the mental, physical, and social condition of the adult; 23 (2) the living arrangements of the adult during the reporting period; 24 (3) a summary of the supported decision making, technological 25 assistance, medical services, educational and vocational services, and other supports 26 and services provided to the adult and the guardian's opinion as to the adequacy of the 27 adult's care; 28 (4) a summary of the guardian's visits with the adult, including the 29 dates of the visits; 30 (5) action taken on behalf of the adult; 31 (6) the extent to which the adult has participated in decision making; 01 (7) if the adult is living in a mental health facility or living in a facility 02 that provides the adult with health care or other personal services, whether the 03 guardian considers the facility's current plan for support, care, treatment, or 04 habilitation consistent with the adult's preferences, values, prior directions, and best 05 interest; 06 (8) anything of more than minimal value that the guardian, any 07 individual who resides with the guardian, or the spouse, parent, child, or sibling of the 08 guardian has received from an individual providing goods or services to the adult; 09 (9) if the guardian delegated a power to an agent, the power delegated 10 and the reason for the delegation; 11 (10) any business relation the guardian has with a person the guardian 12 has paid or that has benefited from the property of the adult; 13 (11) a copy of the guardian's most recently approved plan under 14 AS 13.29.135 and a statement whether the guardian has deviated from the plan and, if 15 so, how the guardian has deviated and why; 16 (12) plans for future care and support of the adult; 17 (13) a recommendation as to the need for continued guardianship and 18 any recommended change in the scope of the guardianship; and 19 (14) whether any co-guardian or successor guardian appointed to serve 20 when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve. 21 (c) The court may appoint a visitor to review a report submitted under this 22 section or a plan of a guardian submitted under AS 13.29.135, interview the guardian 23 or adult subject to guardianship, or investigate any other matter involving the 24 guardianship. 25 (d) Notice of the filing under this section of a guardian's report, together with 26 a copy of the report, must be given to the adult subject to guardianship, a person 27 entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order, and any other person 28 the court determines. The notice and report must be given not later than 14 days after 29 the filing. 30 (e) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report submitted 31 under this section and review each report at least annually to determine whether 01 (1) the report provides sufficient information to establish the guardian 02 has complied with the duties of the guardian; 03 (2) the guardianship should continue; and 04 (3) the guardian's requested fees, if any, should be approved. 05 (f) If the court determines there is reason to believe a guardian for an adult has 06 not complied with the duties of the guardian or the guardianship should be modified or 07 terminated, the court 08 (1) shall notify the adult, the guardian, and any other person entitled to 09 notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order; 10 (2) may require additional information from the guardian; 11 (3) may appoint a visitor to interview the adult or guardian or 12 investigate any matter involving the guardianship; and 13 (4) consistent with AS 13.29.145 and 13.29.150, may hold a hearing to 14 consider removal of the guardian, termination of the guardianship, or a change in the 15 powers granted to the guardian or terms of the guardianship. 16 (g) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a guardian for an adult 17 are not reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to adjust the 18 requested fees. 19 (h) A guardian for an adult may petition the court for approval of a report filed 20 under this section. The court after review may approve the report. If the court 21 approves the report, there is a rebuttable presumption the report is accurate as to a 22 matter adequately disclosed in the report. 23 Sec. 13.29.145. Removal of guardian for adult; appointment of successor. 24 (a) The court may remove a guardian for an adult for failure to perform the duties of 25 the guardian or for other good cause and appoint a successor guardian to assume the 26 duties of guardian. 27 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a guardian 28 for an adult and appoint a successor guardian on 29 (1) petition of the adult, guardian, or person interested in the welfare of 30 the adult, which contains allegations that, if true, would support a reasonable belief 31 that removal of the guardian and appointment of a successor guardian may be 01 appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a petition based on the same 02 or substantially similar facts was filed during the preceding six months; 03 (2) communication from the adult, guardian, or person interested in the 04 welfare of the adult which supports a reasonable belief that removal of the guardian 05 and appointment of a successor guardian may be appropriate; or 06 (3) determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best 07 interest of the adult. 08 (c) Notice of a petition under (b)(1) of this section must be given to the adult 09 subject to guardianship, the guardian, and any other person the court determines. 10 (d) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to remove the guardian and 11 have a successor guardian appointed has the right to choose an attorney to represent 12 the adult in this matter. If the adult is not represented by an attorney, the court shall 13 appoint an attorney under the same conditions in AS 13.29.080. The court shall award 14 reasonable attorney fees to the attorney for the adult as provided in AS 13.29.490. 15 (e) In selecting a successor guardian for an adult, the court shall follow the 16 priorities under AS 13.29.100. 17 (f) Not later than 30 days after appointing a successor guardian, the court shall 18 give notice of the appointment to the adult subject to guardianship and any person 19 entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order. 20 Sec. 13.29.150. Termination or modification of guardianship for adult. (a) 21 An adult subject to guardianship, the guardian for the adult, or a person interested in 22 the welfare of the adult may petition for 23 (1) termination of the guardianship on the ground that a basis for 24 appointment under AS 13.29.060 does not exist or termination would be in the best 25 interest of the adult or for other good cause; or 26 (2) modification of the guardianship on the ground that the extent of 27 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause. 28 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or 29 modification of a guardianship for an adult is appropriate on 30 (1) petition under (a) of this section which contains allegations that, if 31 true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the 01 guardianship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a 02 petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed during the preceding 03 six months; 04 (2) communication from the adult, guardian, or person interested in the 05 welfare of the adult which supports a reasonable belief that termination or 06 modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, including because the functional 07 needs of the adult or supports or services available to the adult have changed; 08 (3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that 09 termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional needs of the 10 adult or supports or services available to the adult have changed or a protective 11 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative for meeting the 12 needs of the adult is available; or 13 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best 14 interest of the adult. 15 (c) Notice of a petition under (b)(1) of this section must be given to the adult 16 subject to guardianship, the guardian, and any other person the court determines. 17 (d) On presentation of prima facie evidence for termination of a guardianship 18 for an adult, the court shall order termination unless it is proven that a basis for 19 appointment of a guardian under AS 13.29.060 exists. 20 (e) The court shall modify the powers granted to a guardian for an adult if the 21 powers are excessive or inadequate because of a change in the abilities or limitations 22 of the adult, the supports of the adult, or other circumstances. 23 (f) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminating or 24 modifying a guardianship for an adult, the court shall follow the same procedures that 25 apply to a petition for guardianship to safeguard the rights of the adult. 26 (g) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to terminate or modify the 27 terms of the guardianship has the right to choose an attorney to represent the adult in 28 the matter. If the adult is not represented by an attorney, the court shall appoint an 29 attorney under the same conditions as in AS 13.29.080. The court shall award 30 reasonable attorney fees to the attorney for the adult as provided in AS 13.29.490. 31 Article 3. Conservatorship. 01 Sec. 13.29.155. Basis for appointment of conservator. (a) On petition and 02 after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a conservator for the property or 03 financial affairs of a minor if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that 04 (1) appointment of a conservator is in the best interest of the minor; if 05 the minor has a parent, the court shall give weight to any recommendation of the 06 parent on whether an appointment is in the best interest of the minor; and 07 (2) one of the following applies: 08 (A) the minor owns funds or other property requiring 09 management or protection that otherwise cannot be provided; 10 (B) the minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put 11 at unreasonable risk or hindered because of the age of the minor; or 12 (C) appointment is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide 13 funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health, or 14 welfare of the minor. 15 (b) On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a 16 conservator for the property or financial affairs of an adult if the court finds by clear 17 and convincing evidence that 18 (1) the adult is unable to manage property or financial affairs because 19 (A) of a limitation in the ability of the adult to receive and 20 evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even with the use of 21 appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision 22 making; or 23 (B) the adult is missing, detained, or unable to return to the 24 United States; 25 (2) appointment is necessary to 26 (A) avoid harm to the adult or significant dissipation of the 27 property of the adult; or 28 (B) obtain or provide funds or other property needed for the 29 support, care, education, health, or welfare of the adult or of an individual 30 entitled to the support of the adult; and 31 (3) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective 01 arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative. 02 (c) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated by 03 demonstrated limitations and needs of the respondent and issue orders that will 04 encourage development of the maximum self-determination and independence of the 05 respondent. The court may not establish a full conservatorship if a limited 06 conservatorship, protective arrangement instead of conservatorship, or other less 07 restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the respondent. 08 Sec. 13.29.160. Petition for appointment of conservator. (a) The following 09 may petition for the appointment of a conservator: 10 (1) the individual for whom the order is sought; 11 (2) a person interested in the estate, financial affairs, or welfare of the 12 individual, including a person that would be adversely affected by lack of effective 13 management of property or financial affairs of the individual;

Appointment and role of attorney. (a) The court shall 28 appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in a proceeding to appoint a 29 conservator if 30 (1) the respondent requests an appointment; 31 (2) the visitor recommends an appointment; or 01 (3) the court determines the respondent needs representation. 02 (b) An attorney representing the respondent in a proceeding for appointment 03 of a conservator shall 04 (1) make reasonable efforts to ascertain the wishes of the respondent; 05 (2) advocate for the wishes of the respondent to the extent reasonably 06 ascertainable; and 07 (3) if the wishes of the respondent are not reasonably ascertainable, 08 advocate for the result that is the least restrictive in type, duration, and scope, 09 consistent with the respondent's interests. 10 Sec. 13.29.185. Professional evaluation. (a) At or before a hearing on a 11 petition for conservatorship for an adult, the court shall order a professional evaluation 12 of the respondent 13 (1) if the respondent requests the evaluation; or 14 (2) in other cases, unless the court finds it has sufficient information to 15 determine the needs and abilities of the respondent without the evaluation. 16 (b) If the court orders an evaluation under (a) of this section, the respondent 17 must be examined by a licensed physician, psychologist, social worker, or other 18 individual appointed by the court who is qualified to evaluate the respondent's alleged 19 cognitive and functional abilities and limitations and does not have a conflict of 20 interest. The individual conducting the evaluation promptly shall file a report in a 21 record with the court. Unless otherwise directed by the court, the report must contain 22 (1) a description of the nature, type, and extent of the respondent's 23 cognitive and functional abilities and limitations with regard to the management of the 24 property and financial affairs of the respondent; 25 (2) an evaluation of the respondent's mental and physical condition 26 and, if appropriate, educational potential, adaptive behavior, and social skills; 27 (3) a prognosis for improvement with regard to the ability to manage 28 the respondent's property and financial affairs; and 29 (4) the date of the examination on which the report is based. 30 (c) A respondent may decline to participate in an evaluation ordered under (a) 31 of this section. 01 Sec. 13.29.190. Attendance and rights at hearing. (a) Except as otherwise 02 provided in (b) of this section, a hearing under AS 13.29.165 may not proceed unless 03 the respondent attends the hearing. If it is not reasonably feasible for the respondent to 04 attend a hearing at the location where court proceedings typically are held, the court 05 shall make reasonable efforts to hold the hearing at an alternative location convenient 06 to the respondent or allow the respondent to attend the hearing using real-time 07 audiovisual technology. 08 (b) A hearing under AS 13.29.165 may proceed without the respondent in 09 attendance if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that 10 (1) the respondent consistently and repeatedly has refused to attend the 11 hearing after having been fully informed of the right to attend and the potential 12 consequences of failing to do so; 13 (2) there is no practicable way for the respondent to attend and 14 participate in the hearing even with appropriate supportive services or technological 15 assistance; or 16 (3) the respondent is a minor who has received proper notice and 17 attendance would be harmful to the minor. 18 (c) The respondent has a right to choose an attorney to represent the 19 respondent at a hearing under AS 13.29.165. 20 (d) At a hearing under AS 13.29.165, the respondent may 21 (1) present evidence and subpoena witnesses and documents; 22 (2) examine witnesses, including any court-appointed evaluator and 23 the visitor; and 24 (3) otherwise participate in the hearing. 25 (e) Unless excused by the court for good cause, a proposed conservator shall 26 attend a hearing under AS 13.29.165. 27 (f) A hearing under AS 13.29.165 must be closed on request of the respondent 28 and a showing of good cause. 29 (g) Any person may request to participate in a hearing under AS 13.29.165. 30 The court may grant the request, with or without a hearing, on determining that the 31 best interest of the respondent will be served. The court may impose appropriate 01 conditions on the person's participation. 02 Sec. 13.29.195. Confidentiality of records. (a) The existence of a proceeding 03 for or the existence of conservatorship is a matter of public record unless the court 04 seals the record after 05 (1) the respondent, the individual subject to conservatorship, or the 06 parent of a minor subject to conservatorship requests that the record be sealed; and 07 (2) either 08 (A) the petition for conservatorship is dismissed; or 09 (B) the conservatorship is terminated. 10 (b) An individual subject to a proceeding for a conservatorship, whether or not 11 a conservator is appointed, an attorney designated by the individual, and a person 12 entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent order may access court 13 records of the proceeding and resulting conservatorship, including the plan of the 14 conservator under AS 13.29.245 and the report of the conservator under AS 13.29.265. 15 A person not otherwise entitled to access court records under this section for good 16 cause may petition the court for access to court records of the conservatorship, 17 including the plan and report of the conservator. The court shall grant access if access 18 is in the best interest of the respondent or individual subject to conservatorship or 19 furthers the public interest and does not endanger the welfare or financial interests of 20 the respondent or individual. 21 (c) A report of a visitor under AS 13.29.175 or professional evaluation under 22 AS 13.29.185 is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to 23 (1) the court; 24 (2) the individual who is the subject of the report or evaluation, 25 without limitation as to use; 26 (3) the petitioner, visitor, and petitioner's and respondent's attorneys, 27 for purposes of the proceeding; 28 (4) unless the court directs otherwise, an agent appointed under a 29 power of attorney under AS 13.26 in which the respondent is identified as the 30 principal; and 31 (5) any other person if it is in the public interest or for a purpose the 01 court orders for good cause. 02 Sec. 13.29.200. Who may be conservator; order of priority. (a) Except as 03 otherwise provided in (c) of this section, the court in appointing a conservator shall 04 consider persons qualified to be a conservator in the following order of priority: 05 (1) a conservator, other than a temporary or emergency conservator, 06 currently acting for the respondent in another jurisdiction; 07 (2) a person nominated as conservator by the respondent, including the 08 respondent's most recent nomination made in a power of attorney under AS 13.26; 09 (3) an agent appointed by the respondent to manage the respondent's 10 property under a power of attorney under AS 13.26; 11 (4) a spouse of the respondent; 12 (5) a family member or other individual who has shown special care 13 and concern for the respondent; 14 (6) a private professional conservator; and 15 (7) the public guardian. 16 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under (a) of this section, the 17 court shall select as conservator the person the court considers best qualified. In 18 determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider the person's relationship 19 with the respondent, the person's skills, the expressed wishes of the respondent, the 20 extent to which the person and the respondent have similar values and preferences, 21 and the likelihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a conservator 22 successfully. 23 (c) If it is in the best interest of the respondent, the court may decline to 24 appoint as conservator a person having priority under (a) of this section and appoint a 25 person having a lower priority or no priority. 26 (d) A person that provides paid services to the respondent, or an individual 27 who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the respondent or is the 28 spouse, parent, or child of an individual who provides or is employed to provide paid 29 services to the respondent, may not be appointed as conservator unless 30 (1) the individual is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or 31 adoption; or 01 (2) the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is 02 the best qualified person available for appointment and the appointment is in the best 03 interest of the respondent. 04 (e) An owner, operator, or employee of a long-term care facility at which the 05 respondent is receiving care may not be appointed as conservator unless the owner, 06 operator, or employee is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption. 07 Sec. 13.29.205. Order of appointment of conservator. (a) A court order 08 appointing a conservator for a minor must include findings to support appointment of 09 a conservator and, if a full conservatorship is granted, the reason a limited 10 conservatorship would not meet the identified needs of the minor. 11 (b) A court order appointing a conservator for an adult must include a specific 12 finding that clear and convincing evidence has established that 13 (1) the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a protective 14 arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative, including 15 use of appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision 16 making; and 17 (2) the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the 18 petition. 19 (c) A court order establishing a full conservatorship for an adult must state the 20 basis for granting a full conservatorship and include specific findings to support the 21 conclusion that a limited conservatorship would not meet the functional needs of the 22 adult. 23 (d) A court order establishing a limited conservatorship must state the specific 24 property placed under the control of the conservator and the powers granted to the 25 conservator. 26 (e) The court, as part of an order establishing a conservatorship, shall identify 27 any person that is entitled to 28 (1) notice of the rights of the individual subject to conservatorship 29 under AS 13.29.210(b); 30 (2) notice of a sale of or surrender of a lease to the primary dwelling of 31 the individual; 01 (3) notice that the conservator has delegated a power that requires 02 court approval under AS 13.29.220 or substantially all powers of the conservator; 03 (4) notice that the conservator will be unavailable to perform the duties 04 of the conservator for more than one month; 05 (5) a copy of the conservator's plan under AS 13.29.245 and the 06 conservator's report under AS 13.29.265; 07 (6) access to court records relating to the conservatorship; 08 (7) notice of a transaction involving a substantial conflict between the 09 fiduciary duties and personal interests of the conservator; 10 (8) notice of the death or significant change in the condition of the 11 individual; 12 (9) notice that the court has limited or modified the powers of the 13 conservator; and 14 (10) notice of the removal of the conservator. 15 (f) If an individual subject to conservatorship is an adult, the spouse and adult 16 children of the adult subject to conservatorship are entitled to notice under (e) of this 17 section unless the court determines notice would be contrary to the preferences or 18 prior directions of the adult subject to conservatorship or not in the best interest of the 19 adult. 20 (g) If an individual subject to conservatorship is a minor, each parent and adult 21 sibling of the minor is entitled to notice under (e) of this section unless the court 22 determines notice would not be in the best interest of the minor. 23 Sec. 13.29.210. Notice of order of appointment; rights. (a) A conservator 24 appointed under AS 13.29.155 shall give to the individual subject to conservatorship 25 and to all other persons given notice under AS 13.29.165 a copy of the order of 26 appointment, together with notice of the right to request termination or modification. 27 The order and notice must be given not later than 14 days after the appointment. 28 (b) Not later than 30 days after appointment of a conservator under 29 AS 13.29.155, the court shall give to the individual subject to conservatorship, the 30 conservator, and any other person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) a statement 31 of the rights of the individual subject to conservatorship and procedures to seek relief 01 if the individual is denied those rights. The statement must be in plain language, in at 02 least 16-point font, and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the individual 03 subject to conservatorship is proficient. The statement must notify the individual 04 subject to conservatorship of the right to 05 (1) seek termination or modification of the conservatorship, or removal 06 of the conservator, and choose an attorney to represent the individual in these matters; 07 (2) participate in decision making to the extent reasonably feasible; 08 (3) receive a copy of the plan of the conservator under AS 13.29.245, 09 the inventory of the conservator under AS 13.29.250, and the report of the conservator 10 under AS 13.29.265; and 11 (4) object to the inventory, plan, or report of the conservator. 12 (c) If a conservator is appointed for the reasons stated in 13 AS 13.29.155(b)(1)(B) and the individual subject to conservatorship is missing, notice 14 under this section to the individual is not required. 15 Sec. 13.29.215. Emergency conservator. (a) On its own or on petition by a 16 person interested in an individual's welfare after a petition has been filed under 17 AS 13.29.160, the court may appoint an emergency conservator for the individual if 18 the court finds 19 (1) appointment of an emergency conservator is likely to prevent 20 substantial and irreparable harm to the property or financial interests of the individual; 21 (2) no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in 22 the circumstances; and 23 (3) there is reason to believe that a basis for appointment of a 24 conservator under AS 13.29.155 exists. 25 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency conservator may not exceed 60 26 days and the emergency conservator may exercise only the powers specified in the 27 order of appointment. The emergency conservator's authority may be extended once 28 for not more than 60 days if the court finds that the conditions for appointment of an 29 emergency conservator under (a) of this section continue. 30 (c) Immediately upon filing of a petition for an emergency conservator, the 31 court shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in the proceeding. Except as 01 otherwise provided in (d) of this section, reasonable notice of the date, time, and place 02 of a hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the respondent's attorney, 03 and any other person the court determines. 04 (d) The court may appoint an emergency conservator without notice to the 05 respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if the court finds from an affidavit 06 or testimony that the property or financial interests of the respondent will be 07 substantially and irreparably harmed before a hearing with notice on the appointment 08 can be held. If the court appoints an emergency conservator without giving notice 09 under (c) of this section, the court must give notice of the appointment not later than 10 48 hours after the appointment to 11 (1) the respondent; 12 (2) the respondent's attorney; and 13 (3) any other person the court determines. 14 (e) Not later than five days after the appointment, the court shall hold a 15 hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment. 16 (f) Appointment of an emergency conservator under this section is not a 17 determination that a basis exists for appointment of a conservator under AS 13.29.155. 18 (g) The court may remove an emergency conservator appointed under this 19 section at any time. The emergency conservator shall make any report the court 20 requires. 21 Sec. 13.29.220. Powers of conservator requiring court approval. (a) Except 22 as otherwise ordered by the court, a conservator must give notice to persons entitled to 23 notice under AS 13.29.165(d) and receive specific authorization by the court before 24 the conservator may exercise with respect to the conservatorship the power to 25 (1) make a gift, except a gift of minimal value; 26 (2) sell, encumber an interest in, or surrender a rental agreement or 27 lease to the primary dwelling of the individual subject to conservatorship; 28 (3) convey, release, or disclaim a contingent or expectant interest in 29 property, including marital property and any right of survivorship incident to joint 30 tenancy or tenancy by the entirety; 31 (4) exercise or release a power of appointment; 01 (5) create a revocable or irrevocable trust of property of the 02 conservatorship estate, whether or not the trust extends beyond the duration of the 03 conservatorship, or revoke or amend a trust revocable by the individual subject to 04 conservatorship; 05 (6) exercise a right to elect an option or change a beneficiary under an 06 insurance policy or annuity or surrender the policy or annuity for its cash value; 07 (7) exercise a right to an elective share in the estate of a deceased 08 spouse of the individual subject to conservatorship or renounce or disclaim a property 09 interest; 10 (8) grant a creditor priority for payment over creditors of the same or 11 higher class if the creditor is providing property or services used to meet the basic 12 living and care needs of the individual subject to conservatorship and preferential 13 treatment otherwise would be impermissible under AS 13.29.290(e); and 14 (9) make, modify, amend, or revoke the will of the individual subject 15 to conservatorship under AS 13.12.502. 16 (b) In approving a conservator's exercise of a power under (a) of this section, 17 the court shall consider primarily the decision the individual subject to conservatorship 18 would make if able, to the extent the decision can be ascertained. 19 (c) To determine the decision the individual subject to conservatorship would 20 make if able under (b) of this section, the court shall consider the individual's prior or 21 current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actually 22 known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. The court also shall consider 23 (1) the financial needs of the individual subject to conservatorship and 24 individuals who are in fact dependent on the individual subject to conservatorship for 25 support and the interests of creditors of the individual; 26 (2) possible reduction of income, estate, inheritance, or other tax 27 liabilities; 28 (3) eligibility for governmental assistance; 29 (4) the previous pattern of giving or level of support provided by the 30 individual; 31 (5) any existing estate plan or lack of estate plan of the individual; 01 (6) the life expectancy of the individual and the probability the 02 conservatorship will terminate before the individual's death; and 03 (7) any other relevant factor. 04 (d) A conservator may not revoke or amend a power of attorney executed 05 under AS 13.26 by the individual subject to conservatorship. If a power of attorney 06 under AS 13.26 is in effect, a decision of the agent takes precedence over that of the 07 conservator, unless the court orders otherwise. 08 Sec. 13.29.225. Petition for order after appointment. An individual subject 09 to conservatorship or a person interested in the welfare of the individual may petition 10 for an order 11 (1) requiring the conservator to furnish a bond or collateral or 12 additional bond or collateral or allowing a reduction in a bond or collateral previously 13 furnished; 14 (2) requiring an accounting for the administration of the 15 conservatorship estate; 16 (3) directing distribution; 17 (4) removing the conservator and appointing a temporary or successor 18 conservator; 19 (5) modifying the type of appointment or powers granted to the 20 conservator, if the extent of protection or management previously granted is excessive 21 or insufficient to meet the needs of the individual, including because the individual's 22 abilities or supports have changed; 23 (6) rejecting or modifying the plan of the conservator under 24 AS 13.29.245, the inventory of the conservator under AS 13.29.250, or the report of 25 the conservator under AS 13.29.265; or 26 (7) granting other appropriate relief. 27 Sec. 13.29.230. Bond; alternative asset protection arrangement. (a) Except 28 as otherwise provided in (c) of this section, the court shall require a conservator to 29 furnish a bond with a surety the court specifies, or require an alternative asset 30 protection arrangement, conditioned on faithful discharge of all duties of the 31 conservator. The court may waive the requirement only if the court finds that a bond 01 or other asset protection arrangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the 02 individual subject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in (c) of this 03 section, the court may not waive the requirement if the conservator is in the business 04 of serving as a conservator and is being paid for the conservator's service. 05 (b) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this section 06 must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the conservatorship estate, plus 07 one year's estimated income, less the value of property deposited under an 08 arrangement requiring a court order for its removal and real property the conservator 09 lacks power to sell or convey without specific court authorization. The court may 10 accept collateral for the performance of the bond in place of surety on a bond, 11 including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of real property. 12 (c) A trust company in this state is not required to give a bond under this 13 section. In this subsection, "trust company" has the meaning given in AS 13.46.990. 14 Sec. 13.29.235. Terms and requirements of bond. (a) Except as otherwise 15 provided by a bond, the surety and the conservator are jointly and severally liable. 16 (b) By executing a bond provided by a conservator, the surety submits to the 17 personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of office to the conservator in a 18 proceeding relating to the duties of the conservator in which the surety is named as a 19 party. Notice of the proceeding must be given to the surety at the address shown in the 20 records of the court in which the bond is filed and any other address of the surety 21 known to the person required to provide the notice. 22 (c) On petition of a successor conservator or person affected by a breach of the 23 obligation of a bond, a proceeding may be brought against the surety for breach of the 24 obligation of the bond. 25 (d) A proceeding against a bond may be brought until liability under the bond 26 is exhausted. 27 (e) A proceeding may not be brought under this section against a surety of a 28 bond on a matter as to which a proceeding against the conservator is barred. 29 (f) If a bond is not renewed by the conservator, the surety or sureties shall 30 immediately give notice to the court and the individual subject to conservatorship. 31 Sec. 13.29.240. Duties of conservator. (a) A conservator is a fiduciary and has 01 duties of prudence and loyalty to the individual subject to conservatorship. 02 (b) A conservator shall promote the self-determination of the individual 03 subject to conservatorship and, to the extent feasible, encourage the individual to 04 participate in decisions, act on the individual's own behalf, and develop or regain the 05 capacity to manage the individual's personal affairs. 06 (c) In making a decision for an individual subject to conservatorship, the 07 conservator shall make the decision the conservator reasonably believes the individual 08 would make if able, unless doing so would fail to preserve the resources needed to 09 maintain the individual's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably harm or 10 endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the individual. To determine 11 the decision the individual would make if able, the conservator shall consider the 12 individual's prior or current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to 13 the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. 14 (d) If a conservator cannot make a decision under (c) of this section because 15 the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably determine the decision the 16 individual subject to conservatorship likely would make if able, or the conservator 17 reasonably believes the decision the individual would make would fail to preserve 18 resources needed to maintain the well-being and lifestyle of the individual or 19 otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests 20 of the individual, the conservator shall act in accordance with the best interest of the 21 individual. In determining the best interest of the individual, the conservator shall 22 consider 23 (1) information received from professionals and persons that 24 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the individual; 25 (2) other information the conservator believes the individual would 26 have considered if the individual were able to act; and 27 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the 28 individual would consider, including consequences for others. 29 (e) Except when inconsistent with the conservator's duties under (a) - (d) of 30 this section, a conservator shall invest and manage the conservatorship estate as a 31 prudent investor would, by considering 01 (1) the circumstances of the individual subject to conservatorship and 02 the conservatorship estate; 03 (2) general economic conditions; 04 (3) the possible effect of inflation or deflation; 05 (4) the expected tax consequences of an investment decision or 06 strategy; 07 (5) the role of each investment or course of action in relation to the 08 conservatorship estate as a whole; 09 (6) the expected total return from income and appreciation of capital; 10 (7) the need for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or 11 appreciation of capital; and 12 (8) the special relationship or value, if any, of specific property to the 13 individual subject to conservatorship. 14 (f) The propriety of a conservator's investment and management of the 15 conservatorship estate is determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing 16 when the conservator decides or acts and not by hindsight. 17 (g) A conservator shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the 18 investment and management of the conservatorship estate. 19 (h) A conservator that has special skills or expertise, or is named conservator 20 in reliance on the conservator's representation of special skills or expertise, has a duty 21 to use the special skills or expertise in carrying out the conservator's duties. 22 (i) In investing, selecting specific property for distribution, and invoking a 23 power of revocation or withdrawal for the use or benefit of the individual subject to 24 conservatorship, a conservator shall consider any estate plan of the individual known 25 or reasonably ascertainable to the conservator and may examine the will or other 26 donative, nominative, or appointive instrument of the individual. 27 (j) A conservator shall maintain insurance on the insurable real and personal 28 property of the individual subject to conservatorship, unless the conservatorship estate 29 lacks sufficient funds to pay for insurance or the court finds 30 (1) the property lacks sufficient equity; or 31 (2) insuring the property would unreasonably dissipate the 01 conservatorship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the individual. 02 (k) If a power of attorney under AS 13.26 is in effect, a conservator shall 03 cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible. 04 (l) A conservator has access to and authority over a digital asset of the 05 individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided under AS 13.63 (Revised 06 Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act) or court order. 07 (m) A conservator for an adult shall notify the court if the condition of the 08 adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising rights previously removed. 09 The notice must be given immediately on learning of the change. 10 Sec. 13.29.245. Conservator's plan. (a) A conservator shall file with the court 11 a plan for protecting, managing, expending, and distributing the assets of the 12 conservatorship estate not later than 60 days after appointment, when there is a 13 significant change in circumstances, or when the conservator seeks to deviate 14 significantly from the conservator's plan. The plan must be based on the needs of the 15 individual subject to conservatorship and take into account the best interest of the 16 individual as well as the individual's preferences, values, and prior directions, to the 17 extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. The conservator shall 18 include in the plan 19 (1) a budget containing projected expenses and resources, including an 20 estimate of the total amount of fees the conservator anticipates charging each year and 21 a statement or list of the amount the conservator proposes to charge for each service 22 the conservator anticipates providing to the individual; 23 (2) how the conservator will involve the individual in decisions about 24 management of the conservatorship estate; 25 (3) any step the conservator plans to take to develop or restore the 26 ability of the individual to manage the conservatorship estate; and 27 (4) an estimate of the duration of the conservatorship. 28 (b) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of the conservator's plan under 29 (a) of this section, together with a copy of the plan, to the individual subject to 30 conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent 31 order, and any other person the court determines. The notice must include a statement 01 of the right to object to the plan and be given not later than 14 days after the filing. 02 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to receive 03 notice and a copy of the plan of the conservator under (b) of this section may object to 04 the plan. 05 (d) The court shall review the plan of the conservator filed under (a) of this 06 section and determine whether to approve the plan or require a new plan. In deciding 07 whether to approve the plan, the court shall consider an objection under (c) of this 08 section and whether the plan is consistent with the duties and powers of the 09 conservator. The court may not approve the plan until 30 days after its filing. 10 (e) After a conservator's plan under this section is approved by the court, the 11 conservator shall provide a copy of the plan to the individual subject to 12 conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent 13 order, and any other person the court determines. 14 Sec. 13.29.250. Inventory; records. (a) Not later than 60 days after 15 appointment, a conservator shall prepare and file with the appointing court a detailed 16 inventory of the conservatorship estate, together with an oath or affirmation that the 17 inventory is believed to be complete and accurate as far as information permits. 18 (b) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of an inventory to the 19 individual subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under 20 AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent order, and any other person the court determines. The 21 notice must be given not later than 14 days after the filing. 22 (c) A conservator shall keep records of the administration of the 23 conservatorship estate and make them available for examination on reasonable request 24 of the individual subject to conservatorship, a guardian for the individual, or any other 25 person the conservator or the court determines. 26 Sec. 13.29.255. Administrative powers of conservator not requiring court 27 approval. (a) Except as otherwise provided in AS 13.29.220 or qualified or limited in 28 the court's order of appointment and stated in the letters of office, a conservator has all 29 powers granted in this section and any additional power granted to a trustee by a law 30 of this state other than this chapter. 31 (b) A conservator, acting reasonably and consistent with the fiduciary duties 01 of the conservator to accomplish the purpose of the conservatorship, without specific 02 court authorization or confirmation, may, with respect to the conservatorship estate, 03 (1) collect, hold, and retain property, including property in which the 04 conservator has a personal interest and real property in another state, until the 05 conservator determines disposition of the property should be made; 06 (2) receive additions to the conservatorship estate; 07 (3) continue or participate in the operation of a business or other 08 enterprise; 09 (4) acquire an undivided interest in property in which the conservator, 10 in a fiduciary capacity, holds an undivided interest;

24 (10) enter for any purpose into a rental agreement or lease of property 25 as lessor or lessee, with or without an option to purchase or renew, for a term within or 26 extending beyond the term of the conservatorship; 27 (11) enter into a lease or arrangement for exploration and removal of 28 minerals or other natural resources or a pooling or unitization agreement; 29 (12) grant an option involving disposition of property or accept or 30 exercise an option for the acquisition of property; 31 (13) vote a security, in person or by general or limited proxy; 01 (14) pay a call, assessment, or other sum chargeable or accruing 02 against or on account of a security; 03 (15) sell or exercise a stock subscription or conversion right; 04 (16) consent, directly or through a committee or agent, to the 05 reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, or liquidation of a corporation or 06 other business enterprise; 07 (17) hold a security in the name of a nominee or in other form without 08 disclosure of the conservatorship so that title to the security may pass by delivery; 09 (18) insure 10 (A) the conservatorship estate, in whole or in part, against 11 damage or loss in accordance with AS 13.29.240(j); and 12 (B) the conservator against liability with respect to a third 13 person; 14 (19) borrow funds, with or without security, to be repaid from the 15 conservatorship estate or otherwise; 16 (20) advance funds for the protection of the conservatorship estate or 17 the individual subject to conservatorship and all expenses, losses, and liability 18 sustained in the administration of the conservatorship estate or because of holding any 19 property for which the conservator has a lien on the conservatorship estate; 20 (21) pay or contest a claim, settle a claim by or against the 21 conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship by compromise, 22 arbitration, or otherwise, or release, in whole or in part, a claim belonging to the 23 conservatorship estate to the extent the claim is uncollectible; 24 (22) pay a tax, assessment, compensation of the conservator or any 25 guardian, and other expense incurred in the collection, care, administration, and 26 protection of the conservatorship estate; 27 (23) pay a sum distributable to the individual subject to 28 conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual subject to 29 conservatorship by paying the sum to the distributee or for the use of the distributee 30 (A) to the guardian for the distributee; 31 (B) to the custodian of the distributee under AS 13.46 (Alaska 01 Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or custodial trustee under AS 13.60 (Alaska 02 Uniform Custodial Trust Act); or 03 (C) if there is no guardian, custodian, or custodial trustee, to a 04 relative or other person having physical custody of the distributee; 05 (24) bring or defend an action, claim, or proceeding in any jurisdiction 06 for the protection of the conservatorship estate or the conservator in the performance 07 of the conservator's duties; 08 (25) structure the finances of the individual subject to conservatorship 09 to establish eligibility for a public benefit, including by making gifts consistent with 10 the individual's preferences, values, and prior directions, if the conservator's action 11 does not jeopardize the individual's welfare and otherwise is consistent with the duties 12 of the conservator; and 13 (26) execute and deliver any instrument that will accomplish or 14 facilitate the exercise of a power of the conservator. 15 Sec. 13.29.260. Distribution from conservatorship estate. (a) Except as 16 otherwise provided in AS 13.29.220 or qualified or limited in the court's order of 17 appointment and stated in the letters of office, and unless contrary to a plan of the 18 conservator under AS 13.29.245, the conservator may expend or distribute income or 19 principal of the conservatorship estate without specific court authorization or 20 confirmation for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the individual 21 subject to conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual 22 subject to conservatorship, including the payment of child or spousal support, in 23 accordance with (b) - (e) of this section. 24 (b) The conservator shall consider a recommendation relating to the 25 appropriate standard of support, care, education, health, or welfare for the individual 26 subject to conservatorship or individual who is dependent on the individual subject to 27 conservatorship, made by a guardian for the individual subject to conservatorship, if 28 any, and, if the individual subject to conservatorship is a minor, a recommendation 29 made by a parent of the minor. 30 (c) The conservator acting in compliance with the conservator's duties under 31 AS 13.29.240 is not liable for an expenditure or distribution made based on a 01 recommendation under (b) of this section unless the conservator knows the 02 expenditure or distribution is not in the best interest of the individual subject to 03 conservatorship. 04 (d) In making an expenditure or distribution under this section, the conservator 05 shall consider 06 (1) the size of the conservatorship estate, the estimated duration of the 07 conservatorship, and the likelihood the individual subject to conservatorship, at some 08 future time, may be fully self-sufficient and able to manage the individual's financial 09 affairs and the conservatorship estate; 10 (2) the accustomed standard of living of the individual subject to 11 conservatorship and individual who is dependent on the individual subject to 12 conservatorship; 13 (3) other funds or source used for the support of the individual subject 14 to conservatorship; and 15 (4) the preferences, values, and prior directions of the individual 16 subject to conservatorship. 17 (e) Funds expended or distributed under this section may be paid by the 18 conservator to any person, including the individual subject to conservatorship, as 19 reimbursement for expenditures the conservator might have made, or in advance for 20 services to be provided to the individual subject to conservatorship or individual who 21 is dependent on the individual subject to conservatorship if it is reasonable to expect 22 the services will be performed and advance payment is customary or reasonably 23 necessary under the circumstances. 24 Sec. 13.29.265. Conservator's report and accounting; monitoring. (a) A 25 conservator shall file with the court a report in a record regarding the administration of 26 the conservatorship estate annually unless the court otherwise directs, on resignation 27 or removal, on termination of the conservatorship, and at any other time the court 28 directs. 29 (b) A report under (a) of this section must state or contain 30 (1) an accounting that lists property included in the conservatorship 31 estate and the receipts, disbursements, liabilities, and distributions during the period 01 for which the report is made; 02 (2) a list of the services provided to the individual subject to 03 conservatorship; 04 (3) a copy of the most recently approved plan of the conservator and a 05 statement whether the conservator has deviated from the plan and, if so, how the 06 conservator has deviated and why; 07 (4) a recommendation as to the need for continued conservatorship and 08 any recommended change in the scope of the conservatorship; 09 (5) to the extent feasible, a copy of the most recent reasonably 10 available financial statements evidencing the status of bank accounts, investment 11 accounts, and mortgages or other debts of the individual subject to conservatorship 12 with all but the last four digits of the account numbers and Social Security number 13 redacted; 14 (6) anything of more than minimal value that the conservator, any 15 individual who resides with the conservator, or the spouse, parent, child, or sibling of 16 the conservator has received from a person providing goods or services to the 17 individual subject to conservatorship; 18 (7) any business relation the conservator has with a person the 19 conservator has paid or that has benefited from the property of the individual subject 20 to conservatorship; and 21 (8) whether any co-conservator or successor conservator appointed to 22 serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve. 23 (c) The court may appoint a visitor to review a report under this section or the 24 plan of the conservator under AS 13.29.245, interview the individual subject to 25 conservatorship or conservator, or investigate any other matter involving the 26 conservatorship. In connection with the report, the court may order the conservator to 27 submit the conservatorship estate to appropriate examination in a manner the court 28 directs. 29 (d) Notice of the filing under this section of a conservator's report, together 30 with a copy of the report, must be provided to the individual subject to 31 conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent 01 order, and other persons the court determines. The notice and report must be given not 02 later than 14 days after filing. 03 (e) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report submitted 04 under this section and review each report at least annually to determine whether 05 (1) the reports provide sufficient information to establish the 06 conservator has complied with the conservator's duties; 07 (2) the conservatorship should continue; and 08 (3) the requested fees of the conservator, if any, should be approved. 09 (f) If the court determines there is reason to believe a conservator has not 10 complied with the conservator's duties or the conservatorship should not continue, the 11 court 12 (1) shall notify the individual subject to conservatorship, the 13 conservator, and any other person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a 14 subsequent order; 15 (2) may require additional information from the conservator; 16 (3) may appoint a visitor to interview the individual subject to 17 conservatorship or conservator or investigate any matter involving the 18 conservatorship; and 19 (4) consistent with AS 13.29.300 and 13.29.305, may hold a hearing to 20 consider removal of the conservator, termination of the conservatorship, or a change in 21 the powers granted to the conservator or terms of the conservatorship. 22 (g) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a conservator are not 23 reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to adjust the requested 24 fees. 25 (h) A conservator may petition the court for approval of a report filed under 26 this section. The court after review may approve the report. If the court approves the 27 report, there is a rebuttable presumption the report is accurate as to a matter adequately 28 disclosed in the report. 29 (i) An order, after notice and hearing, approving an interim report of a 30 conservator filed under this section adjudicates liabilities concerning a matter 31 adequately disclosed in the report, as to a person given notice of the report or 01 accounting. 02 (j) An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report filed under this 03 section discharges the conservator from all liabilities, claims, and causes of action by a 04 person given notice of the report and the hearing as to a matter adequately disclosed in 05 the report. 06 Sec. 13.29.270. Attempted transfer of property by individual subject to 07 conservatorship. (a) The interest of an individual subject to conservatorship in 08 property included in the conservatorship estate is not transferrable or assignable by the 09 individual and is not subject to levy, garnishment, or similar process for claims against 10 the individual unless allowed under AS 13.29.290. 11 (b) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a contract after 12 having the right to enter the contract removed by the court, the contract is void against 13 the individual and the property of the individual but is enforceable against the person 14 that contracted with the individual. 15 (c) A person other than the conservator that deals with an individual subject to 16 conservatorship with respect to property included in the conservatorship estate is 17 entitled to protection provided by law of this state other than this chapter. 18 Sec. 13.29.275. Transaction involving conflict of interest. A transaction 19 involving a conservatorship estate which is affected by a substantial conflict between 20 the conservator's fiduciary duties and personal interests is voidable unless the 21 transaction is authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice under 22 AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent order. A transaction affected by a substantial conflict 23 includes a sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate 24 entered into by the conservator, an individual with whom the conservator resides, the 25 spouse, descendant, sibling, agent, or attorney of the conservator, or a corporation or 26 other enterprise in which the conservator has a substantial beneficial interest. 27 Sec. 13.29.280. Protection of person dealing with conservator. (a) A person 28 that assists or deals with a conservator in good faith and for value in any transaction, 29 other than a transaction requiring a court order under AS 13.29.220, is protected as 30 though the conservator properly exercised any power in question. Knowledge by a 31 person that the person is dealing with a conservator alone does not require the person 01 to inquire into the existence of authority of the conservator or the propriety of the 02 conservator's exercise of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of 03 office, or otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A person that pays 04 or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for proper application of the 05 property. 06 (b) Protection under (a) of this section extends to a procedural irregularity or 07 jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the issuance of letters of office and 08 does not substitute for protection for a person that assists or deals with a conservator 09 provided by comparable provisions in law of this state other than this chapter relating 10 to a commercial transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary. 11 Sec. 13.29.285. Death of individual subject to conservatorship. (a) If an 12 individual subject to conservatorship dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for 13 safekeeping any will of the individual in the possession of the conservator and inform 14 the personal representative named in the will if feasible, or if not feasible, a 15 beneficiary named in the will, of the delivery. 16 (b) On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator 17 shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate as provided in (c) of 18 this section and AS 13.29.305. 19 (c) If, after 40 days from the death of the individual subject to 20 conservatorship, no other person has been appointed personal representative and no 21 application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator of the 22 individual on the date of the individual's death may apply to exercise the powers and 23 duties of a personal representative in order to proceed with administering and 24 distributing the decedent's estate without additional or further appointment. Upon 25 application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a 26 conservator, after notice to any person demanding notice under AS 13.16.070 and to 27 any person nominated executor in any will of which the applicant is aware, the court 28 may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection, and 29 endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the individual formerly subject to 30 conservatorship is deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers 31 and duties of a personal representative. The making and entry of an order under this 01 subsection has the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as 02 provided in AS 13.16.115 and 13.16.245 - 13.16.655 except that estate in the name of 03 the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent's successors 04 without prior retransfer to the conservator as personal representative. 05 Sec. 13.29.290. Presentation and allowance of claim. (a) A conservator may 06 pay, or secure by encumbering property included in the conservatorship estate, a claim 07 against the conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship arising 08 before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and allowance in accordance 09 with the priorities under (d) of this section. A claimant may present a claim by 10 (1) sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of 11 the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount 12 claimed; or 13 (2) filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court, 14 and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator. 15 (b) A claim under (a) of this section is presented on receipt by the conservator 16 of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of the claim, whichever first 17 occurs. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed in whole or in part by the 18 conservator in a record sent or delivered to the claimant not later than 60 days after its 19 presentation. Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim 20 to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court order or 21 order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls until 30 days after 22 disallowance of the claim the running of a statute of limitations that has not expired 23 relating to the claim. 24 (c) A claimant whose claim under (a) of this section has not been paid may 25 petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is barred by a statute of 26 limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment, or security by 27 encumbering property included in the conservatorship estate. If a proceeding is 28 pending against the individual subject to conservatorship at the time of appointment of 29 the conservator or is initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator 30 notice of the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the 31 conservatorship estate. 01 (d) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all existing 02 claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money or in kind in 03 payment of claims in the following order: 04 (1) costs and expenses of administration; 05 (2) a claim of the federal or state government having priority under law 06 other than this chapter; 07 (3) a claim incurred by the conservator for support, care, education, 08 health, or welfare previously provided to the individual subject to conservatorship or 09 an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual subject to conservatorship; 10 (4) a claim arising before the conservatorship; and 11 (5) all other claims. 12 (e) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under (d) of this 13 section over another claim of the same class. A claim due and payable may not be 14 preferred over a claim not due unless 15 (1) doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without sufficient 16 funds to pay the basic living and health care expenses of the individual subject to 17 conservatorship; and 18 (2) the court authorizes the preference under AS 13.29.220(a)(8). 19 (f) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all existing 20 claims, the court may order the conservator to grant a security interest in the 21 conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future date if it is in the best interest 22 of the individual subject to conservatorship. 23 Sec. 13.29.295. Personal liability of conservator. (a) Except as otherwise 24 agreed by a conservator, the conservator is not personally liable on a contract properly 25 entered into in a fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the 26 conservatorship estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the conservator's 27 representative capacity in the contract or before entering into the contract. 28 (b) A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising from control of 29 property of the conservatorship estate or an act or omission occurring in the course of 30 administration of the conservatorship estate only if the conservator is personally at 31 fault. 01 (c) A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a fiduciary 02 capacity, an obligation arising from control of property included in the 03 conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course of administration of the 04 conservatorship estate may be asserted against the conservatorship estate in a 05 proceeding against the conservator in a fiduciary capacity, whether or not the 06 conservator is personally liable for the claim. 07 (d) A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the 08 conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge, 09 or indemnification or another appropriate proceeding or action. 10 Sec. 13.29.300. Removal of conservator; appointment of successor. (a) The 11 court may remove a conservator for failure to perform the duties of the conservator or 12 other good cause and appoint a successor conservator to assume the duties of the 13 conservator. 14 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a 15 conservator and appoint a successor on 16 (1) petition of the individual subject to conservatorship, conservator, or 17 person interested in the welfare of the individual which contains allegations that, if 18 true, would support a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and 19 appointment of a successor may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a 20 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed during 21 the preceding six months; 22 (2) communication from the individual subject to conservatorship, 23 conservator, or person interested in the welfare of the individual which supports a 24 reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and appointment of a successor may 25 be appropriate; or 26 (3) determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best 27 interest of the individual subject to conservatorship. 28 (c) Notice of a petition under (b)(1) of this section must be given to the 29 individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, and any other person the court 30 determines. 31 (d) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to remove the 01 conservator and have a successor appointed has the right to choose an attorney to 02 represent the individual in this matter. If the individual is not represented by an 03 attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions as in 04 AS 13.29.180.

Termination or modification of conservatorship. (a) A 12 conservatorship for a minor terminates on the earliest of 13 (1) a court order terminating the conservatorship; 14 (2) the minor becoming an adult or, if the minor consents or the court 15 finds by clear and convincing evidence that substantial harm to the minor's interests is 16 otherwise likely, attaining 21 years of age; 17 (3) emancipation of the minor; or 18 (4) death of the minor. 19 (b) A conservatorship for an adult terminates on order of the court or when the 20 adult dies. 21 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, or a person 22 interested in the welfare of the individual may petition for 23 (1) termination of the conservatorship on the ground that a basis for 24 appointment under AS 13.29.155 does not exist or termination would be in the best 25 interest of the individual or for other good cause; or 26 (2) modification of the conservatorship on the ground that the extent of 27 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause. 28 (d) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or 29 modification of a conservatorship is appropriate on 30 (1) petition under (c) of this section which contains allegations that, if 31 true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the 01 conservatorship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a 02 petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed within the preceding 03 six months; 04 (2) a communication from the individual subject to conservatorship, 05 conservator, or person interested in the welfare of the individual which supports a 06 reasonable belief that termination or modification of the conservatorship may be 07 appropriate, including because the functional needs of the individual or supports or 08 services available to the individual have changed; 09 (3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that 10 termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional needs or 11 supports or services available to the individual have changed or a protective 12 arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative is available; 13 or 14 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best 15 interest of the individual. 16 (e) Notice of a petition under (c) of this section must be given to the individual 17 subject to conservatorship, the conservator, and any other person the court determines. 18 (f) On presentation of prima facie evidence for termination of a 19 conservatorship, the court shall order termination unless it is proven that a basis for 20 appointment of a conservator under AS 13.29.155 exists. 21 (g) The court shall modify the powers granted to a conservator if the powers 22 are excessive or inadequate because of a change in the abilities or limitations of the 23 individual subject to conservatorship, the supports of the individual, or other 24 circumstances. 25 (h) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminating a 26 conservatorship, the court shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of 27 the individual subject to conservatorship which apply to a petition for conservatorship. 28 (i) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to terminate or modify 29 the terms of the conservatorship has the right to choose an attorney to represent the 30 individual in this matter. If the individual is not represented by an attorney, the court 31 shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions as in AS 13.29.180. The court 01 shall award reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as provided in AS 13.29.490. 02 (j) On termination of a conservatorship other than because of the death of the 03 individual subject to conservatorship, property of the conservatorship estate passes to 04 the individual. The order of termination must direct the conservator to file a final 05 report and petition for discharge on approval by the court of the final report. 06 (k) On termination of a conservatorship because of the death of the individual 07 subject to conservatorship, the conservator shall promptly file a final report and 08 petition for discharge on approval by the court of the final report. On approval of the 09 final report, the conservator shall proceed expeditiously to distribute the 10 conservatorship estate to the individual's estate or as otherwise ordered by the court. 11 The conservator may take reasonable measures necessary to preserve the 12 conservatorship estate until distribution can be made. 13 (l) The court shall issue a final order of discharge on the approval by the court 14 of the final report and satisfaction by the conservator of any other condition the court 15 imposed on the conservator's discharge. 16 Sec. 13.29.310. Payment of debt and delivery of property to foreign 17 conservator without local proceedings. (a) Any person indebted to or having 18 possession of property or of an instrument evidencing a debt, stock, or chose in action 19 belonging to an individual subject to conservatorship under the law of another state 20 may pay or deliver to a conservator, guardian of the estate, or other like fiduciary 21 appointed by a court of the state of residence of the individual, upon being presented 22 with proof of the fiduciary's appointment and an affidavit made by the fiduciary or on 23 the fiduciary's behalf stating: 24 (1) that no protective proceeding relating to the individual is pending 25 in this state; and 26 (2) that the foreign conservator is entitled to payment or to receive 27 delivery. 28 (b) If the person to whom the affidavit is presented is not aware of any 29 protective proceeding pending in this state, payment or delivery in response to the 30 demand and affidavit discharges the debtor or possessor. 31 Sec. 13.29.315.

(a) Unless a person required to transfer funds or other property to a 02 minor knows that a conservator for the minor has been appointed or a proceeding is 03 pending for conservatorship, the person may transfer an amount or value not 04 exceeding $15,000 in a 12-month period to 05 (1) a person that has care or custody of the minor and with whom the 06 minor resides; 07 (2) a guardian for the minor; 08 (3) a custodian under AS 13.46 (Alaska Uniform Transfers to Minors 09 Act); or 10 (4) a financial institution as a deposit in an interest-bearing account or 11 certificate solely in the name of the minor and shall give notice to the minor of the 12 deposit. 13 (b) A person that transfers funds or other property under this section is not 14 responsible for its proper application. 15 (c) A person that receives funds or other property for a minor under (a)(1) or 16 (2) of this section may apply it only to the support, care, education, health, or welfare 17 of the minor, and may not derive a personal financial benefit from it, except for 18 reimbursement for necessary expenses. Funds not applied for these purposes must be 19 preserved for the future support, care, education, health, or welfare of the minor, and 20 the balance, if any, transferred to the minor when the minor becomes an adult or 21 otherwise is emancipated. 22 Article 4.

(a) After a hearing under AS 13.29.015, the court may 10 appoint a guardian for a minor if appointment is proper under AS 13.29.005, dismiss 11 the proceeding, or take other appropriate action consistent with state law. 12 (b) In appointing a guardian under (a) of this section, the following rules 13 apply: 14 (1) the court shall appoint a person nominated as guardian by a parent 15 of the minor in a will or other record unless the court finds the appointment is contrary 16 to the best interest of the minor; 17 (2) if multiple parents have nominated different persons to serve as 18 guardian, the court shall appoint the nominee whose appointment is in the best interest 19 of the minor, unless the court finds that appointment of the nominees is not in the best 20 interest of the minor; 21 (3) if a guardian is not appointed under (1) or (2) of this subsection, the 22 court shall appoint the person nominated by the minor if the minor is 12 years of age 23 or older unless the court finds that appointment is contrary to the best interest of the 24 minor; in that case, the court shall appoint as guardian a person whose appointment is 25 in the best interest of the minor. 26 (c) In the interest of maintaining or encouraging involvement by a minor's 27 parent in the minor's life, developing self-reliance of the minor, or for other good 28 cause, the court, at the time of appointment of a guardian for the minor or later, on its 29 own or on motion of the minor or another interested person, may create a limited 30 guardianship by limiting the powers otherwise granted to the guardian under 31 AS 13.29.005 - 13.29.055. Following the same procedure, the court may grant 01 additional powers or withdraw powers previously granted. 02 (d) The court, as part of an order appointing a guardian for a minor, shall state 03 rights retained by any parent of the minor, which may include contact or visitation 04 with the minor; decision making regarding the minor's health care, education, or other 05 matters; or access to a record regarding the minor. 06 (e) An order granting a guardianship for a minor must 07 (1) state that each parent of the minor is entitled to notice that 08 (A) the guardian has delegated custody of the minor subject to 09 guardianship; 10 (B) the court has modified or limited the powers of the 11 guardian; or 12 (C) the court has removed the guardian; and 13 (2) identify any person in addition to a parent of the minor who is 14 entitled to notice of the events listed in (1) of this subsection. 15 Sec. 13.29.035. Standby guardian for minor. (a) A standby guardian 16 appointed under this section may act as guardian, with all duties and powers of a 17 guardian under AS 13.29.045 and 13.29.050, if the minor does not have a parent 18 willing or able to exercise the duties and powers granted to the guardian. 19 (b) A parent of a minor, in a signed record, may nominate a person to be 20 appointed by the court as standby guardian for the minor. The parent, in a signed 21 record, may state desired limitations on the powers to be granted to the standby 22 guardian. The parent, in a signed record, may revoke or amend the nomination at any 23 time before the court appoints a standby guardian. 24 (c) The court may appoint a standby guardian for a minor on 25 (1) petition by a parent of the minor or a person nominated as a 26 standby guardian under (b) of this section; and 27 (2) finding that the minor does not have a parent who will likely be 28 able or willing to care for or make decisions with respect to the minor not later than 29 two years after the appointment. 30 (d) A petition under (c)(1) of this section must include the same information 31 required under AS 13.29.010 for the appointment of a guardian for a minor. 01 (e) On filing a petition under (c)(1) of this section, the petitioner shall 02 (1) serve a copy of the petition personally on 03 (A) the minor, if the minor is 12 years of age or older, and the 04 minor's attorney, if any; 05 (B) each parent of the minor; 06 (C) the person nominated as standby guardian; and 07 (D) any other person the court determines should receive a 08 copy; and 09 (2) include with the copy of the petition served under (1) of this 10 subsection a statement of the right to request appointment of an attorney for the minor 11 or to object to appointment of the standby guardian, and a description of the nature, 12 purpose, and consequences of appointment of a standby guardian. 13 (f) Not later than 60 days after service of the petition and statement, a person 14 entitled to notice under (e) of this section may object to appointment of the standby 15 guardian by filing an objection with the court and giving notice of the objection to any 16 other person entitled to notice under (e) of this section. 17 (g) If an objection is filed under (f) of this section, the court shall hold a 18 hearing to determine whether a standby guardian should be appointed and, if so, the 19 person that should be appointed. If no objection is filed, the court may make the 20 appointment. 21 (h) The court may not grant a petition for a standby guardian of the minor if 22 notice substantially complying with (e) of this section is not served on 23 (1) the minor, if the minor is 12 years of age or older; and 24 (2) each parent of the minor, unless the court finds by clear and 25 convincing evidence that the parent, in a record, waived the right to notice or cannot 26 be located and served with due diligence. 27 (i) If a petitioner is unable to serve notice under (e) of this section on a parent 28 of the minor or alleges that a parent of the minor waived the right to notice under this 29 section, the court shall appoint a visitor who shall 30 (1) interview the petitioner and the minor; 31 (2) if the petitioner alleges the parent cannot be located and served, 01 ascertain whether the parent cannot be located with due diligence; and 02 (3) investigate any other matter relating to the petition the court 03 directs. 04 (j) If the court finds under (c) of this section that a standby guardian should be 05 appointed, the following rules apply: 06 (1) the court shall appoint the person nominated under (b) of this 07 section unless the court finds the appointment is contrary to the best interest of the 08 minor; 09 (2) if the parents have nominated different persons to serve as standby 10 guardian, the court shall appoint the nominee whose appointment is in the best interest 11 of the minor, unless the court finds that appointment of the nominees is not in the best 12 interest of the minor. 13 (k) An order appointing a standby guardian under this section must state that 14 each parent of the minor is entitled to notice, and identify any other person entitled to 15 notice, if 16 (1) the standby guardian assumes the duties and powers of the 17 guardian; 18 (2) the guardian delegates custody of the minor; 19 (3) the court modifies or limits the powers of the guardian; or 20 (4) the court removes the guardian. 21 (l) Before assuming the duties and powers of a guardian, a standby guardian 22 must file with the court an acceptance of appointment as guardian and give notice of 23 the acceptance to 24 (1) each parent of the minor, unless the parent, in a record, waived the 25 right to notice or cannot be located and served with due diligence; 26 (2) the minor, if the minor is 12 years of age or older; and 27 (3) any person, other than the parent, having care or custody of the 28 minor. 29 (m) A person that receives notice under (l) of this section or any other person 30 interested in the welfare of the minor may file with the court an objection to the 31 standby guardian's assumption of duties and powers of a guardian. The court shall 01 hold a hearing if the objection supports a reasonable belief that the conditions for 02 assumption of duties and powers have not been satisfied. 03 Sec. 13.29.040. Emergency guardian for minor. (a) On its own, or on 04 petition by a person interested in a minor's welfare, the court may appoint an 05 emergency guardian for the minor if the court finds 06 (1) appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent 07 substantial harm to the minor's health, safety, or welfare; and 08 (2) no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in 09 the circumstances. 10 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for a minor may not 11 exceed 60 days and the emergency guardian may exercise only the powers specified in 12 the order of appointment. The emergency guardian's authority may be extended once 13 for not more than 60 days if the court finds that the conditions for appointment of an 14 emergency guardian in (a) of this section continue. 15 (c) Except as otherwise provided in (d) of this section, reasonable notice of the 16 date, time, and place of a hearing on a petition for appointment of an emergency 17 guardian for a minor must be given to 18 (1) the minor, if the minor is 12 years of age or older; 19 (2) any attorney appointed under AS 13.29.020; 20 (3) each parent of the minor; 21 (4) any person, other than a parent, having care or custody of the 22 minor; and 23 (5) any other person the court determines should receive notice. 24 (d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for a minor without notice 25 under (c) of this section and without a hearing only if the court finds from an affidavit 26 or testimony that the minor's health, safety, or welfare will be substantially harmed 27 before a hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an 28 emergency guardian without notice to an unrepresented minor or the attorney for a 29 represented minor, notice of the appointment must be given not later than 48 hours 30 after the appointment to the individuals listed in (c) of this section. Not later than five 31 days after the appointment, the court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the 01 appointment. 02 (e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section, with or without 03 notice, is not a determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under 04 AS 13.29.005. 05 (f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this section 06 at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court requires. 07 Sec. 13.29.045. Duties of guardian for minor. (a) A guardian for a minor is a 08 fiduciary.

(a) The existence of a proceeding 16 for or the existence of a guardianship for an adult is a matter of public record unless 17 the court seals the record after 18 (1) the respondent or individual subject to guardianship requests that 19 the record be sealed; and 20 (2) either 21 (A) the petition for guardianship is dismissed; or 22 (B) the guardianship is terminated. 23 (b) An adult subject to a proceeding for a guardianship, whether or not a 24 guardian is appointed, an attorney designated by the adult, and a person entitled to 25 notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order are entitled to access court records 26 of the proceeding and resulting guardianship, including the guardian's plan under 27 AS 13.29.135 and report under AS 13.29.140. A person not otherwise entitled to 28 access court records under this subsection for good cause may petition the court for 29 access to court records of the guardianship, including the report and plan of the 30 guardian. The court shall grant access if access is in the best interest of the respondent 31 or adult subject to guardianship or furthers the public interest and does not endanger 01 the welfare or financial interests of the adult. 02 (c) A report of a visitor under AS 13.29.075 or a professional evaluation under 03 AS 13.29.085 is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to 04 (1) the court; 05 (2) the individual who is the subject of the report or evaluation, 06 without limitation as to use; 07 (3) the petitioner, visitor, and petitioner's and respondent's attorneys, 08 for purposes of the proceeding; 09 (4) unless the court orders otherwise, an agent appointed under a 10 durable power of attorney for health care under AS 13.52 or power of attorney under 11 AS 13.26 in which the respondent is the principal; and 12 (5) any other person if it is in the public interest or for a purpose the 13 court orders for good cause. 14 Sec. 13.29.100. Who may be guardian for adult; order of priority. (a) 15 Except as otherwise provided in (c) of this section, the court in appointing a guardian 16 for an adult shall consider persons qualified to be guardian in the following order of 17 priority: 18 (1) a guardian, other than a temporary or emergency guardian, 19 currently acting for the respondent in another jurisdiction; 20 (2) a person nominated as guardian by the respondent, including the 21 respondent's most recent nomination made in a power of attorney under AS 13.26; 22 (3) an agent appointed by the respondent under a durable power of 23 attorney for health care under AS 13.52; 24 (4) a spouse of the respondent; 25 (5) a family member or other individual who has shown special care 26 and concern for the respondent; 27 (6) a private professional guardian; and 28 (7) the public guardian. 29 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under (a) of this section, the 30 court shall select as guardian the person the court considers best qualified. In 31 determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider the relationship of the 01 person with the respondent, the skills of the person, the expressed wishes of the 02 respondent, the extent to which the person and the respondent have similar values and 03 preferences, and the likelihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a 04 guardian successfully. 05 (c) If it is in the best interest of the respondent, the court may decline to 06 appoint as guardian a person having priority under (a) of this section and appoint a 07 person having a lower priority or no priority. 08 (d) A person that provides paid services to the respondent, or an individual 09 who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the respondent or is the 10 spouse, parent, or child of an individual who provides or is employed to provide paid 11 services to the respondent, may not be appointed as guardian unless 12 (1) the individual is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or 13 adoption; or 14 (2) the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is 15 the best qualified person available for appointment and the appointment is in the best 16 interest of the respondent. 17 (e) An owner, operator, or employee of a long-term care facility at which the 18 respondent is receiving care may not be appointed as guardian unless the owner, 19 operator, or employee is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption. 20 Sec. 13.29.105. Order of appointment for guardian. (a) A court order 21 appointing a guardian for an adult must 22 (1) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence 23 established that the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a protective 24 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative, including use 25 of appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision 26 making; 27 (2) include a specific finding that clear and convincing evidence 28 established that the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the petition; 29 (3) state whether the adult subject to guardianship retains the right to 30 vote and, if the adult does not retain the right to vote, include findings that support 31 removing that right, which must include a finding that the adult cannot communicate, 01 with or without support, a specific desire to participate in the voting process; and 02 (4) state whether the adult subject to guardianship retains the right to 03 marry and, if the adult does not retain the right to marry, include findings that support 04 removing that right. 05 (b) An adult subject to guardianship retains the right to vote unless the order 06 under (a) of this section includes the statement required under (a)(3) of this section. 07 An adult subject to guardianship retains the right to marry unless the order under (a) of 08 this section includes the findings required under (a)(4) of this section. 09 (c) A court order establishing a full guardianship for an adult must state the 10 basis for granting a full guardianship and include specific findings that support the 11 conclusion that a limited guardianship would not meet the functional needs of the 12 adult subject to guardianship. 13 (d) A court order establishing a limited guardianship for an adult must state 14 the specific powers granted to the guardian. 15 (e) The court, as part of an order establishing a guardianship for an adult, shall 16 identify any person that is entitled to 17 (1) notice of the rights of the adult under AS 13.29.110(b); 18 (2) notice of a change in the primary dwelling of the adult; 19 (3) notice that the guardian has delegated 20 (A) the power to manage the care of the adult; 21 (B) the power to make decisions about where the adult lives; 22 (C) the power to make major medical decisions on behalf of the 23 adult; 24 (D) a power that requires court approval under AS 13.29.130; 25 or 26 (E) substantially all powers of the guardian; 27 (4) notice that the guardian will be unavailable to visit the adult for 28 more than two months or unavailable to perform the guardian's duties for more than 29 one month; 30 (5) a copy of the plan of the guardian under AS 13.29.135 and the 31 report of the guardian under AS 13.29.140; 01 (6) access to court records relating to the guardianship; 02 (7) notice of the death or significant change in the condition of the 03 adult; 04 (8) notice that the court has limited or modified the powers of the 05 guardian; and 06 (9) notice of the removal of the guardian. 07 (f) A spouse and adult children of an adult subject to guardianship are entitled 08 to notice under (e) of this section unless the court determines notice would be contrary 09 to the preferences or prior directions of the adult subject to guardianship or not in the 10 best interest of the adult. 11 Sec. 13.29.110. Notice of order of appointment; rights. (a) A guardian 12 appointed under AS 13.29.060 shall give the adult subject to guardianship and all 13 other persons given notice under AS 13.29.070 a copy of the order of appointment, 14 together with notice of the right to request termination or modification. The order and 15 notice must be given not later than 14 days after the appointment. 16 (b) Not later than 30 days after appointment of a guardian under 17 AS 13.29.060, the court shall give to the adult subject to guardianship, the guardian, 18 and any other person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order a 19 statement of the rights of the adult subject to guardianship and procedures to seek 20 relief if the adult is denied those rights. The statement must be in at least 16-point font, 21 in plain language, and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the adult subject 22 to guardianship is proficient. The statement must notify the adult subject to 23 guardianship of the right to 24 (1) seek termination or modification of the guardianship or removal of 25 the guardian, and choose an attorney to represent the adult in these matters; 26 (2) be involved in decisions affecting the adult, including decisions 27 about the adult's care, dwelling, activities, or social interactions, to the extent 28 reasonably feasible; 29 (3) be involved in health care decision making to the extent reasonably 30 feasible; 31 (4) be supported in understanding the risks and benefits of health care 01 options to the extent reasonably feasible; 02 (5) be notified at least 14 days before a change in the adult's primary 03 dwelling or permanent move to a nursing home, mental health facility, or other facility 04 that places restrictions on the individual's ability to leave or have visitors unless the 05 change or move is proposed in the plan of the guardian under AS 13.29.135 or 06 authorized by the court by specific order; 07 (6) object to a change or move described in (5) of this subsection and 08 the process for objecting; 09 (7) communicate, visit, or interact with others, including receiving 10 visitors, and making or receiving telephone calls, personal mail, or electronic 11 communications, including through social media, unless 12 (A) the guardian has been authorized by the court by specific 13 order to restrict communications, visits, or interactions; 14 (B) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of 15 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person; or 16 (C) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is 17 necessary because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant 18 physical, psychological, or financial harm to the adult, and the restriction is 19 (i) for a period of not more than seven business days if 20 the person has a family or pre-existing social relationship with the 21 adult; or 22 (ii) for a period of not more than 60 days if the person 23 does not have a family or pre-existing social relationship with the adult; 24 (8) receive a copy of the plan of the guardian under AS 13.29.135 and 25 the report of the guardian under AS 13.29.140; and 26 (9) object to the plan or report of the guardian. 27 Sec. 13.29.115. Emergency guardian for adult. (a) On its own after a petition 28 has been filed under AS 13.29.065, or on petition by a person interested in an adult's 29 welfare, the court may appoint an emergency guardian for the adult if the court finds 30 (1) appointment of an emergency guardian is likely to prevent 31 substantial harm to the adult's physical health, safety, or welfare; 01 (2) no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in 02 the circumstances; and 03 (3) there is reason to believe that a basis for appointment of a guardian 04 under AS 13.29.060 exists. 05 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency guardian for an adult may not 06 exceed 60 days, and the emergency guardian may exercise only the powers specified 07 in the order of appointment. The authority of the emergency guardian may be 08 extended once for not more than 60 days if the court finds that the conditions for 09 appointment of an emergency guardian under (a) of this section continue. 10 (c) Immediately on filing of a petition for appointment of an emergency 11 guardian for an adult, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in 12 the proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in (d) of this section, reasonable notice 13 of the date, time, and place of a hearing on the petition must be given to the 14 respondent, the respondent's attorney, and any other person the court determines. 15 (d) The court may appoint an emergency guardian for an adult without notice 16 to the adult and any attorney for the adult only if the court finds from an affidavit or 17 testimony that the respondent's physical health, safety, or welfare will be substantially 18 harmed before a hearing with notice on the appointment can be held. If the court 19 appoints an emergency guardian without giving notice under (c) of this section, the 20 court must 21 (1) give notice of the appointment, not later than 48 hours after the 22 appointment, to 23 (A) the respondent; 24 (B) the respondent's attorney; and 25 (C) any other person the court determines; and 26 (2) hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment not later 27 than five days after the appointment. 28 (e) Appointment of an emergency guardian under this section is not a 29 determination that a basis exists for appointment of a guardian under AS 13.29.060. 30 (f) The court may remove an emergency guardian appointed under this section 31 at any time. The emergency guardian shall make any report the court requires. 01 Sec. 13.29.120. Duties of guardian for adult. (a) A guardian for an adult is a 02 fiduciary. Except as otherwise limited by the court, a guardian for an adult shall make 03 decisions regarding the support, care, education, health, and welfare of the adult 04 subject to guardianship to the extent necessitated by the limitations of the adult. 05 (b) A guardian for an adult shall promote the self-determination of the adult 06 and, to the extent reasonably feasible, encourage the adult to participate in decisions, 07 act on the adult's own behalf, and develop or regain the capacity to manage the adult's 08 personal affairs. In furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall 09 (1) become or remain personally acquainted with the adult and 10 maintain sufficient contact with the adult, including through regular visitation, to 11 know the adult's abilities, limitations, needs, opportunities, and physical and mental 12 health; 13 (2) to the extent reasonably feasible, identify the values and 14 preferences of the adult and involve the adult in decisions affecting the adult, 15 including decisions about the adult's care, dwelling, activities, or social interactions; 16 and 17 (3) make reasonable efforts to identify and facilitate supportive 18 relationships and services for the adult. 19 (c) A guardian for an adult at all times shall exercise reasonable care, 20 diligence, and prudence when acting on behalf of or making decisions for the adult. In 21 furtherance of this duty, the guardian shall 22 (1) take reasonable care of the personal effects, pets, and service or 23 support animals of the adult and bring a proceeding for a conservatorship or protective 24 arrangement instead of conservatorship if necessary to protect the property of the 25 adult; 26 (2) expend funds and other property of the adult received by the 27 guardian for the adult's current needs for support, care, education, health, and welfare; 28 (3) conserve any funds and other property of the adult not expended 29 under (2) of this subsection for the future needs of the adult, but if a conservator has 30 been appointed for the adult, the guardian shall pay the funds and other property at 31 least quarterly to the conservator to be conserved for the future needs of the adult; and 01 (4) monitor the quality of services, including long-term care services, 02 provided to the adult. 03 (d) In making a decision for an adult subject to guardianship, the guardian 04 shall make the decision the guardian reasonably believes the adult would make if the 05 adult were able unless doing so would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or 06 personal or financial interests of the adult. To determine the decision the adult subject 07 to guardianship would make if able, the guardian shall consider the adult's previous or 08 current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actually 09 known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. 10 (e) If a guardian for an adult cannot make a decision under (d) of this section 11 because the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably determine the decision the 12 adult likely would make if able, or the guardian reasonably believes the decision the 13 adult would make would unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or 14 financial interests of the adult, the guardian shall act in accordance with the best 15 interest of the adult. In determining the best interest of the adult, the guardian shall 16 consider 17 (1) information received from professionals and persons that 18 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the adult; 19 (2) other information the guardian believes the adult would have 20 considered if the adult were able to act; and 21 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the adult 22 would consider, including consequences for others. 23 (f) A guardian for an adult shall immediately notify the court if the condition 24 of the adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising rights previously 25 removed. 26 Sec. 13.29.125. Powers of guardian for adult. (a) Except as limited by court 27 order, a guardian for an adult may 28 (1) apply for and receive funds and benefits for the support of the 29 adult, unless a conservator is appointed for the adult and the application or receipt is 30 within the powers of the conservator; 31 (2) unless inconsistent with a court order, establish the adult's place of 01 dwelling; 02 (3) consent to health or other care, treatment, or service for the adult; 03 (4) if a conservator for the adult has not been appointed, commence a 04 proceeding, including an administrative proceeding, or take other appropriate action to 05 compel another person to support the adult or pay funds for the benefit of the adult; 06 (5) to the extent reasonable, delegate to the adult responsibility for a 07 decision affecting the adult's well-being; and 08 (6) receive personally identifiable health care information regarding 09 the adult. 10 (b) The court by specific order may authorize a guardian for an adult to 11 consent to the adoption of the adult. In determining whether to authorize a power 12 under this subsection, the court shall consider whether the underlying act would be in 13 accordance with the preferences, values, and prior directions of the adult and whether 14 the underlying act would be in the best interest of the adult. 15 (c) In exercising a guardian's power to establish the place of dwelling of the 16 adult under (a)(2) of this section, the guardian shall 17 (1) select a residential setting the guardian believes the adult would 18 select if the adult were able, in accordance with the decision-making standard under 19 AS 13.29.120(d) and (e); if the guardian does not know and cannot reasonably 20 determine what setting the adult subject to guardianship would likely choose if able, or 21 the guardian reasonably believes the decision the adult would make would 22 unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the 23 adult, the guardian shall choose a residential setting that is consistent with the best 24 interest of the adult in accordance with AS 13.29.120(e); 25 (2) in selecting among residential settings, give priority to a residential 26 setting in a location that will allow the adult to interact with persons important to the 27 adult and meet the needs of the adult in the least restrictive manner reasonably feasible 28 unless to do so would be inconsistent with the decision-making standard in 29 AS 13.29.120(d) and (e); 30 (3) not later than 30 days after a change in the dwelling of the adult, 31 (A) give notice of the change to the court, the adult, and any 01 person identified as entitled to the notice in the court order appointing the 02 guardian or a subsequent order; and 03 (B) include in the notice the address and nature of the new 04 dwelling and state whether the adult received advance notice of the change and 05 whether the adult objected to the change; 06 (4) establish or move the permanent place of dwelling of the adult to a 07 nursing home, mental health facility, or other facility that places restrictions on the 08 adult's ability to leave or have visitors only if 09 (A) the establishment or move is in the plan of the guardian 10 under AS 13.29.135; 11 (B) the court authorizes the establishment or move; or 12 (C) the guardian gives notice of the establishment or move at 13 least 14 days before the establishment or move to the adult and all persons 14 entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e)(2) or a subsequent order, and no 15 objection is filed; 16 (5) establish or move the place of dwelling of the adult outside this 17 state only if consistent with the plan of the guardian and authorized by the court by 18 specific order; and 19 (6) take action that would result in the sale of the primary dwelling or 20 surrender of the rental agreement or lease to the primary dwelling of the adult only if 21 (A) the action is specifically included in the plan of the 22 guardian under AS 13.29.135; 23 (B) the court authorizes the action by specific order; or 24 (C) notice of the action was given at least 14 days before the 25 action to the adult and all persons entitled to the notice under 26 AS 13.29.105(e)(2) or a subsequent order and no objection has been filed. 27 (d) In exercising a guardian's power under (a)(3) of this section to make health 28 care decisions, the guardian shall 29 (1) involve the adult in decision making to the extent reasonably 30 feasible, including, when practicable, by encouraging and supporting the adult in 31 understanding the risks and benefits of health care options; 01 (2) defer to a decision by an agent under a durable power of attorney 02 for health care executed under AS 13.52 by the adult and cooperate to the extent 03 feasible with the agent making the decision; and 04 (3) take into account 05 (A) the risks and benefits of treatment options; and 06 (B) the current and previous wishes and values of the adult if 07 known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. 08 Sec. 13.29.130. Special limitations on guardian's power. (a) Unless 09 authorized by the court by specific order, a guardian for an adult does not have the 10 power to revoke or amend a durable power of attorney for health care under AS 13.52 11 or durable power of attorney under AS 13.26 executed by the adult. If a durable power 12 of attorney for health care under AS 13.52 is in effect, unless there is a court order to 13 the contrary, a health care decision of an agent takes precedence over that of the 14 guardian, and the guardian shall cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible. If a 15 durable power of attorney under AS 13.26 is in effect, unless there is a court order to 16 the contrary, a decision by the agent that the agent is authorized to make under the 17 power of attorney takes precedence over that of the guardian, and the guardian shall 18 cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible. 19 (b) A guardian for an adult may not initiate the commitment of the adult to a 20 mental health facility except in accordance with the procedure for involuntary 21 commitment under AS 47.30. 22 (c) A guardian for an adult may not restrict the ability of the adult to 23 communicate, visit, or interact with others, including receiving visitors and making or 24 receiving telephone calls, personal mail, or electronic communications, including 25 through social media, or participating in social activities, unless 26 (1) authorized by the court by specific order; 27 (2) a protective order or protective arrangement instead of 28 guardianship is in effect that limits contact between the adult and a person; or 29 (3) the guardian has good cause to believe restriction is necessary 30 because interaction with a specified person poses a risk of significant physical, 31 psychological, or financial harm to the adult and the restriction is for a period of not 01 more than 02 (A) seven business days if the person has a family or pre- 03 existing social relationship with the adult; or 04 (B) 60 days if the person does not have a family or pre-existing 05 social relationship with the adult. 06 (d) A guardian for an adult may not prohibit the marriage or divorce of the 07 adult if the adult retains the right to marry under AS 13.29.105. 08 Sec. 13.29.135. Guardian's plan. (a) A guardian for an adult shall file with 09 the court a plan for the care of the adult not later than 60 days after appointment, when 10 there is a significant change in circumstances, or when the guardian seeks to deviate 11 significantly from the guardian's plan. The plan must be based on the needs of the 12 adult and take into account the best interest of the adult as well as the adult's 13 preferences, values, and prior directions, to the extent known to or reasonably 14 ascertainable by the guardian. The guardian shall include in the plan 15 (1) the living arrangement, services, and supports the guardian expects 16 to arrange, facilitate, or continue for the adult; 17 (2) social and educational activities the guardian expects to facilitate 18 on behalf of the adult; 19 (3) any person with whom the adult has a close personal relationship or 20 relationship involving regular visitation and any plan the guardian has for facilitating 21 visits with the person; 22 (4) the anticipated nature and frequency of the guardian's visits and 23 communication with the adult; 24 (5) goals for the adult, including goals related to the restoration of the 25 rights of the adult and how the guardian anticipates achieving the goals; 26 (6) whether the adult has an existing plan and, if so, whether the plan 27 of the guardian is consistent with the plan of the adult; and 28 (7) a statement or list of the amount the guardian proposes to charge 29 for each service the guardian anticipates providing to the adult. 30 (b) A guardian shall give notice of the filing of the guardian's plan under (a) of 31 this section, together with a copy of the plan, to the adult subject to guardianship, a 01 person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order, and any other 02 person the court determines. The notice must include a statement of the right to object 03 to the plan and be given not later than 14 days after the filing. 04 (c) An adult subject to guardianship and any person entitled under (b) of this 05 section to receive notice and a copy of the plan of the guardian may object to the plan. 06 (d) The court shall review the plan of the guardian filed under (a) of this 07 section and determine whether to approve the plan or require a new plan. In deciding 08 whether to approve the plan, the court shall consider an objection under (c) of this 09 section and whether the plan is consistent with the guardian's duties and powers under 10 AS 13.29.120 and 13.29.125. The court may not approve the plan until 30 days after 11 its filing. 12 (e) After the plan of the guardian filed under this section is approved by the 13 court, the guardian shall provide a copy of the plan to the adult subject to 14 guardianship, a person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.105(e) or a subsequent order, 15 and any other person the court determines. 16 Sec. 13.29.140.

Termination or modification of guardianship for adult. (a) 21 An adult subject to guardianship, the guardian for the adult, or a person interested in 22 the welfare of the adult may petition for 23 (1) termination of the guardianship on the ground that a basis for 24 appointment under AS 13.29.060 does not exist or termination would be in the best 25 interest of the adult or for other good cause; or 26 (2) modification of the guardianship on the ground that the extent of 27 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause. 28 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or 29 modification of a guardianship for an adult is appropriate on 30 (1) petition under (a) of this section which contains allegations that, if 31 true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the 01 guardianship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a 02 petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed during the preceding 03 six months; 04 (2) communication from the adult, guardian, or person interested in the 05 welfare of the adult which supports a reasonable belief that termination or 06 modification of the guardianship may be appropriate, including because the functional 07 needs of the adult or supports or services available to the adult have changed; 08 (3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that 09 termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional needs of the 10 adult or supports or services available to the adult have changed or a protective 11 arrangement instead of guardianship or other less restrictive alternative for meeting the 12 needs of the adult is available; or 13 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best 14 interest of the adult. 15 (c) Notice of a petition under (b)(1) of this section must be given to the adult 16 subject to guardianship, the guardian, and any other person the court determines. 17 (d) On presentation of prima facie evidence for termination of a guardianship 18 for an adult, the court shall order termination unless it is proven that a basis for 19 appointment of a guardian under AS 13.29.060 exists. 20 (e) The court shall modify the powers granted to a guardian for an adult if the 21 powers are excessive or inadequate because of a change in the abilities or limitations 22 of the adult, the supports of the adult, or other circumstances. 23 (f) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminating or 24 modifying a guardianship for an adult, the court shall follow the same procedures that 25 apply to a petition for guardianship to safeguard the rights of the adult. 26 (g) An adult subject to guardianship who seeks to terminate or modify the 27 terms of the guardianship has the right to choose an attorney to represent the adult in 28 the matter. If the adult is not represented by an attorney, the court shall appoint an 29 attorney under the same conditions as in AS 13.29.080. The court shall award 30 reasonable attorney fees to the attorney for the adult as provided in AS 13.29.490. 31 Article 3. Conservatorship. 01 Sec. 13.29.155. Basis for appointment of conservator. (a) On petition and 02 after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a conservator for the property or 03 financial affairs of a minor if the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that 04 (1) appointment of a conservator is in the best interest of the minor; if 05 the minor has a parent, the court shall give weight to any recommendation of the 06 parent on whether an appointment is in the best interest of the minor; and 07 (2) one of the following applies: 08 (A) the minor owns funds or other property requiring 09 management or protection that otherwise cannot be provided; 10 (B) the minor has or may have financial affairs that may be put 11 at unreasonable risk or hindered because of the age of the minor; or 12 (C) appointment is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide 13 funds or other property needed for the support, care, education, health, or 14 welfare of the minor. 15 (b) On petition and after notice and hearing, the court may appoint a 16 conservator for the property or financial affairs of an adult if the court finds by clear 17 and convincing evidence that 18 (1) the adult is unable to manage property or financial affairs because 19 (A) of a limitation in the ability of the adult to receive and 20 evaluate information or make or communicate decisions, even with the use of 21 appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision 22 making; or 23 (B) the adult is missing, detained, or unable to return to the 24 United States; 25 (2) appointment is necessary to 26 (A) avoid harm to the adult or significant dissipation of the 27 property of the adult; or 28 (B) obtain or provide funds or other property needed for the 29 support, care, education, health, or welfare of the adult or of an individual 30 entitled to the support of the adult; and 31 (3) the respondent's identified needs cannot be met by a protective 01 arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative. 02 (c) The court shall grant a conservator only those powers necessitated by 03 demonstrated limitations and needs of the respondent and issue orders that will 04 encourage development of the maximum self-determination and independence of the 05 respondent. The court may not establish a full conservatorship if a limited 06 conservatorship, protective arrangement instead of conservatorship, or other less 07 restrictive alternative would meet the needs of the respondent. 08 Sec. 13.29.160.

The court shall grant access if access 18 is in the best interest of the respondent or individual subject to conservatorship or 19 furthers the public interest and does not endanger the welfare or financial interests of 20 the respondent or individual. 21 (c) A report of a visitor under AS 13.29.175 or professional evaluation under 22 AS 13.29.185 is confidential and must be sealed on filing, but is available to 23 (1) the court; 24 (2) the individual who is the subject of the report or evaluation, 25 without limitation as to use; 26 (3) the petitioner, visitor, and petitioner's and respondent's attorneys, 27 for purposes of the proceeding; 28 (4) unless the court directs otherwise, an agent appointed under a 29 power of attorney under AS 13.26 in which the respondent is identified as the 30 principal; and 31 (5) any other person if it is in the public interest or for a purpose the 01 court orders for good cause. 02 Sec. 13.29.200. Who may be conservator; order of priority. (a) Except as 03 otherwise provided in (c) of this section, the court in appointing a conservator shall 04 consider persons qualified to be a conservator in the following order of priority: 05 (1) a conservator, other than a temporary or emergency conservator, 06 currently acting for the respondent in another jurisdiction; 07 (2) a person nominated as conservator by the respondent, including the 08 respondent's most recent nomination made in a power of attorney under AS 13.26; 09 (3) an agent appointed by the respondent to manage the respondent's 10 property under a power of attorney under AS 13.26; 11 (4) a spouse of the respondent; 12 (5) a family member or other individual who has shown special care 13 and concern for the respondent; 14 (6) a private professional conservator; and 15 (7) the public guardian. 16 (b) If two or more persons have equal priority under (a) of this section, the 17 court shall select as conservator the person the court considers best qualified. In 18 determining the best qualified person, the court shall consider the person's relationship 19 with the respondent, the person's skills, the expressed wishes of the respondent, the 20 extent to which the person and the respondent have similar values and preferences, 21 and the likelihood the person will be able to perform the duties of a conservator 22 successfully. 23 (c) If it is in the best interest of the respondent, the court may decline to 24 appoint as conservator a person having priority under (a) of this section and appoint a 25 person having a lower priority or no priority. 26 (d) A person that provides paid services to the respondent, or an individual 27 who is employed by a person that provides paid services to the respondent or is the 28 spouse, parent, or child of an individual who provides or is employed to provide paid 29 services to the respondent, may not be appointed as conservator unless 30 (1) the individual is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or 31 adoption; or 01 (2) the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is 02 the best qualified person available for appointment and the appointment is in the best 03 interest of the respondent. 04 (e) An owner, operator, or employee of a long-term care facility at which the 05 respondent is receiving care may not be appointed as conservator unless the owner, 06 operator, or employee is related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption. 07 Sec. 13.29.205. Order of appointment of conservator. (a) A court order 08 appointing a conservator for a minor must include findings to support appointment of 09 a conservator and, if a full conservatorship is granted, the reason a limited 10 conservatorship would not meet the identified needs of the minor. 11 (b) A court order appointing a conservator for an adult must include a specific 12 finding that clear and convincing evidence has established that 13 (1) the identified needs of the respondent cannot be met by a protective 14 arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative, including 15 use of appropriate supportive services, technological assistance, or supported decision 16 making; and 17 (2) the respondent was given proper notice of the hearing on the 18 petition. 19 (c) A court order establishing a full conservatorship for an adult must state the 20 basis for granting a full conservatorship and include specific findings to support the 21 conclusion that a limited conservatorship would not meet the functional needs of the 22 adult. 23 (d) A court order establishing a limited conservatorship must state the specific 24 property placed under the control of the conservator and the powers granted to the 25 conservator. 26 (e) The court, as part of an order establishing a conservatorship, shall identify 27 any person that is entitled to 28 (1) notice of the rights of the individual subject to conservatorship 29 under AS 13.29.210(b); 30 (2) notice of a sale of or surrender of a lease to the primary dwelling of 31 the individual; 01 (3) notice that the conservator has delegated a power that requires 02 court approval under AS 13.29.220 or substantially all powers of the conservator; 03 (4) notice that the conservator will be unavailable to perform the duties 04 of the conservator for more than one month; 05 (5) a copy of the conservator's plan under AS 13.29.245 and the 06 conservator's report under AS 13.29.265; 07 (6) access to court records relating to the conservatorship; 08 (7) notice of a transaction involving a substantial conflict between the 09 fiduciary duties and personal interests of the conservator; 10 (8) notice of the death or significant change in the condition of the 11 individual; 12 (9) notice that the court has limited or modified the powers of the 13 conservator; and 14 (10) notice of the removal of the conservator. 15 (f) If an individual subject to conservatorship is an adult, the spouse and adult 16 children of the adult subject to conservatorship are entitled to notice under (e) of this 17 section unless the court determines notice would be contrary to the preferences or 18 prior directions of the adult subject to conservatorship or not in the best interest of the 19 adult. 20 (g) If an individual subject to conservatorship is a minor, each parent and adult 21 sibling of the minor is entitled to notice under (e) of this section unless the court 22 determines notice would not be in the best interest of the minor. 23 Sec. 13.29.210. Notice of order of appointment; rights. (a) A conservator 24 appointed under AS 13.29.155 shall give to the individual subject to conservatorship 25 and to all other persons given notice under AS 13.29.165 a copy of the order of 26 appointment, together with notice of the right to request termination or modification. 27 The order and notice must be given not later than 14 days after the appointment. 28 (b) Not later than 30 days after appointment of a conservator under 29 AS 13.29.155, the court shall give to the individual subject to conservatorship, the 30 conservator, and any other person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) a statement 31 of the rights of the individual subject to conservatorship and procedures to seek relief 01 if the individual is denied those rights. The statement must be in plain language, in at 02 least 16-point font, and, to the extent feasible, in a language in which the individual 03 subject to conservatorship is proficient. The statement must notify the individual 04 subject to conservatorship of the right to 05 (1) seek termination or modification of the conservatorship, or removal 06 of the conservator, and choose an attorney to represent the individual in these matters; 07 (2) participate in decision making to the extent reasonably feasible; 08 (3) receive a copy of the plan of the conservator under AS 13.29.245, 09 the inventory of the conservator under AS 13.29.250, and the report of the conservator 10 under AS 13.29.265; and 11 (4) object to the inventory, plan, or report of the conservator. 12 (c) If a conservator is appointed for the reasons stated in 13 AS 13.29.155(b)(1)(B) and the individual subject to conservatorship is missing, notice 14 under this section to the individual is not required. 15 Sec. 13.29.215. Emergency conservator. (a) On its own or on petition by a 16 person interested in an individual's welfare after a petition has been filed under 17 AS 13.29.160, the court may appoint an emergency conservator for the individual if 18 the court finds 19 (1) appointment of an emergency conservator is likely to prevent 20 substantial and irreparable harm to the property or financial interests of the individual; 21 (2) no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in 22 the circumstances; and 23 (3) there is reason to believe that a basis for appointment of a 24 conservator under AS 13.29.155 exists. 25 (b) The duration of authority of an emergency conservator may not exceed 60 26 days and the emergency conservator may exercise only the powers specified in the 27 order of appointment. The emergency conservator's authority may be extended once 28 for not more than 60 days if the court finds that the conditions for appointment of an 29 emergency conservator under (a) of this section continue. 30 (c) Immediately upon filing of a petition for an emergency conservator, the 31 court shall appoint an attorney to represent the respondent in the proceeding. Except as 01 otherwise provided in (d) of this section, reasonable notice of the date, time, and place 02 of a hearing on the petition must be given to the respondent, the respondent's attorney, 03 and any other person the court determines. 04 (d) The court may appoint an emergency conservator without notice to the 05 respondent and any attorney for the respondent only if the court finds from an affidavit 06 or testimony that the property or financial interests of the respondent will be 07 substantially and irreparably harmed before a hearing with notice on the appointment 08 can be held. If the court appoints an emergency conservator without giving notice 09 under (c) of this section, the court must give notice of the appointment not later than 10 48 hours after the appointment to 11 (1) the respondent; 12 (2) the respondent's attorney; and 13 (3) any other person the court determines. 14 (e) Not later than five days after the appointment, the court shall hold a 15 hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment. 16 (f) Appointment of an emergency conservator under this section is not a 17 determination that a basis exists for appointment of a conservator under AS 13.29.155. 18 (g) The court may remove an emergency conservator appointed under this 19 section at any time. The emergency conservator shall make any report the court 20 requires. 21 Sec. 13.29.220. Powers of conservator requiring court approval. (a) Except 22 as otherwise ordered by the court, a conservator must give notice to persons entitled to 23 notice under AS 13.29.165(d) and receive specific authorization by the court before 24 the conservator may exercise with respect to the conservatorship the power to 25 (1) make a gift, except a gift of minimal value; 26 (2) sell, encumber an interest in, or surrender a rental agreement or 27 lease to the primary dwelling of the individual subject to conservatorship; 28 (3) convey, release, or disclaim a contingent or expectant interest in 29 property, including marital property and any right of survivorship incident to joint 30 tenancy or tenancy by the entirety; 31 (4) exercise or release a power of appointment; 01 (5) create a revocable or irrevocable trust of property of the 02 conservatorship estate, whether or not the trust extends beyond the duration of the 03 conservatorship, or revoke or amend a trust revocable by the individual subject to 04 conservatorship; 05 (6) exercise a right to elect an option or change a beneficiary under an 06 insurance policy or annuity or surrender the policy or annuity for its cash value; 07 (7) exercise a right to an elective share in the estate of a deceased 08 spouse of the individual subject to conservatorship or renounce or disclaim a property 09 interest; 10 (8) grant a creditor priority for payment over creditors of the same or 11 higher class if the creditor is providing property or services used to meet the basic 12 living and care needs of the individual subject to conservatorship and preferential 13 treatment otherwise would be impermissible under AS 13.29.290(e); and 14 (9) make, modify, amend, or revoke the will of the individual subject 15 to conservatorship under AS 13.12.502. 16 (b) In approving a conservator's exercise of a power under (a) of this section, 17 the court shall consider primarily the decision the individual subject to conservatorship 18 would make if able, to the extent the decision can be ascertained. 19 (c) To determine the decision the individual subject to conservatorship would 20 make if able under (b) of this section, the court shall consider the individual's prior or 21 current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to the extent actually 22 known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. The court also shall consider 23 (1) the financial needs of the individual subject to conservatorship and 24 individuals who are in fact dependent on the individual subject to conservatorship for 25 support and the interests of creditors of the individual; 26 (2) possible reduction of income, estate, inheritance, or other tax 27 liabilities; 28 (3) eligibility for governmental assistance; 29 (4) the previous pattern of giving or level of support provided by the 30 individual; 31 (5) any existing estate plan or lack of estate plan of the individual; 01 (6) the life expectancy of the individual and the probability the 02 conservatorship will terminate before the individual's death; and 03 (7) any other relevant factor. 04 (d) A conservator may not revoke or amend a power of attorney executed 05 under AS 13.26 by the individual subject to conservatorship. If a power of attorney 06 under AS 13.26 is in effect, a decision of the agent takes precedence over that of the 07 conservator, unless the court orders otherwise. 08 Sec. 13.29.225. Petition for order after appointment. An individual subject 09 to conservatorship or a person interested in the welfare of the individual may petition 10 for an order 11 (1) requiring the conservator to furnish a bond or collateral or 12 additional bond or collateral or allowing a reduction in a bond or collateral previously 13 furnished; 14 (2) requiring an accounting for the administration of the 15 conservatorship estate; 16 (3) directing distribution; 17 (4) removing the conservator and appointing a temporary or successor 18 conservator; 19 (5) modifying the type of appointment or powers granted to the 20 conservator, if the extent of protection or management previously granted is excessive 21 or insufficient to meet the needs of the individual, including because the individual's 22 abilities or supports have changed; 23 (6) rejecting or modifying the plan of the conservator under 24 AS 13.29.245, the inventory of the conservator under AS 13.29.250, or the report of 25 the conservator under AS 13.29.265; or 26 (7) granting other appropriate relief. 27 Sec. 13.29.230. Bond; alternative asset protection arrangement. (a) Except 28 as otherwise provided in (c) of this section, the court shall require a conservator to 29 furnish a bond with a surety the court specifies, or require an alternative asset 30 protection arrangement, conditioned on faithful discharge of all duties of the 31 conservator. The court may waive the requirement only if the court finds that a bond 01 or other asset protection arrangement is not necessary to protect the interests of the 02 individual subject to conservatorship. Except as otherwise provided in (c) of this 03 section, the court may not waive the requirement if the conservator is in the business 04 of serving as a conservator and is being paid for the conservator's service. 05 (b) Unless the court directs otherwise, the bond required under this section 06 must be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the conservatorship estate, plus 07 one year's estimated income, less the value of property deposited under an 08 arrangement requiring a court order for its removal and real property the conservator 09 lacks power to sell or convey without specific court authorization. The court may 10 accept collateral for the performance of the bond in place of surety on a bond, 11 including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of real property. 12 (c) A trust company in this state is not required to give a bond under this 13 section. In this subsection, "trust company" has the meaning given in AS 13.46.990. 14 Sec. 13.29.235. Terms and requirements of bond. (a) Except as otherwise 15 provided by a bond, the surety and the conservator are jointly and severally liable. 16 (b) By executing a bond provided by a conservator, the surety submits to the 17 personal jurisdiction of the court that issued letters of office to the conservator in a 18 proceeding relating to the duties of the conservator in which the surety is named as a 19 party. Notice of the proceeding must be given to the surety at the address shown in the 20 records of the court in which the bond is filed and any other address of the surety 21 known to the person required to provide the notice. 22 (c) On petition of a successor conservator or person affected by a breach of the 23 obligation of a bond, a proceeding may be brought against the surety for breach of the 24 obligation of the bond. 25 (d) A proceeding against a bond may be brought until liability under the bond 26 is exhausted. 27 (e) A proceeding may not be brought under this section against a surety of a 28 bond on a matter as to which a proceeding against the conservator is barred. 29 (f) If a bond is not renewed by the conservator, the surety or sureties shall 30 immediately give notice to the court and the individual subject to conservatorship. 31 Sec. 13.29.240. Duties of conservator. (a) A conservator is a fiduciary and has 01 duties of prudence and loyalty to the individual subject to conservatorship. 02 (b) A conservator shall promote the self-determination of the individual 03 subject to conservatorship and, to the extent feasible, encourage the individual to 04 participate in decisions, act on the individual's own behalf, and develop or regain the 05 capacity to manage the individual's personal affairs. 06 (c) In making a decision for an individual subject to conservatorship, the 07 conservator shall make the decision the conservator reasonably believes the individual 08 would make if able, unless doing so would fail to preserve the resources needed to 09 maintain the individual's well-being and lifestyle or otherwise unreasonably harm or 10 endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests of the individual. To determine 11 the decision the individual would make if able, the conservator shall consider the 12 individual's prior or current directions, preferences, opinions, values, and actions, to 13 the extent actually known or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. 14 (d) If a conservator cannot make a decision under (c) of this section because 15 the conservator does not know and cannot reasonably determine the decision the 16 individual subject to conservatorship likely would make if able, or the conservator 17 reasonably believes the decision the individual would make would fail to preserve 18 resources needed to maintain the well-being and lifestyle of the individual or 19 otherwise unreasonably harm or endanger the welfare or personal or financial interests 20 of the individual, the conservator shall act in accordance with the best interest of the 21 individual. In determining the best interest of the individual, the conservator shall 22 consider 23 (1) information received from professionals and persons that 24 demonstrate sufficient interest in the welfare of the individual; 25 (2) other information the conservator believes the individual would 26 have considered if the individual were able to act; and 27 (3) other factors a reasonable person in the circumstances of the 28 individual would consider, including consequences for others. 29 (e) Except when inconsistent with the conservator's duties under (a) - (d) of 30 this section, a conservator shall invest and manage the conservatorship estate as a 31 prudent investor would, by considering 01 (1) the circumstances of the individual subject to conservatorship and 02 the conservatorship estate; 03 (2) general economic conditions; 04 (3) the possible effect of inflation or deflation; 05 (4) the expected tax consequences of an investment decision or 06 strategy; 07 (5) the role of each investment or course of action in relation to the 08 conservatorship estate as a whole; 09 (6) the expected total return from income and appreciation of capital; 10 (7) the need for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or 11 appreciation of capital; and 12 (8) the special relationship or value, if any, of specific property to the 13 individual subject to conservatorship. 14 (f) The propriety of a conservator's investment and management of the 15 conservatorship estate is determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing 16 when the conservator decides or acts and not by hindsight. 17 (g) A conservator shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the 18 investment and management of the conservatorship estate. 19 (h) A conservator that has special skills or expertise, or is named conservator 20 in reliance on the conservator's representation of special skills or expertise, has a duty 21 to use the special skills or expertise in carrying out the conservator's duties. 22 (i) In investing, selecting specific property for distribution, and invoking a 23 power of revocation or withdrawal for the use or benefit of the individual subject to 24 conservatorship, a conservator shall consider any estate plan of the individual known 25 or reasonably ascertainable to the conservator and may examine the will or other 26 donative, nominative, or appointive instrument of the individual. 27 (j) A conservator shall maintain insurance on the insurable real and personal 28 property of the individual subject to conservatorship, unless the conservatorship estate 29 lacks sufficient funds to pay for insurance or the court finds 30 (1) the property lacks sufficient equity; or 31 (2) insuring the property would unreasonably dissipate the 01 conservatorship estate or otherwise not be in the best interest of the individual. 02 (k) If a power of attorney under AS 13.26 is in effect, a conservator shall 03 cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible. 04 (l) A conservator has access to and authority over a digital asset of the 05 individual subject to conservatorship to the extent provided under AS 13.63 (Revised 06 Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act) or court order. 07 (m) A conservator for an adult shall notify the court if the condition of the 08 adult has changed so that the adult is capable of exercising rights previously removed. 09 The notice must be given immediately on learning of the change. 10 Sec. 13.29.245. Conservator's plan. (a) A conservator shall file with the court 11 a plan for protecting, managing, expending, and distributing the assets of the 12 conservatorship estate not later than 60 days after appointment, when there is a 13 significant change in circumstances, or when the conservator seeks to deviate 14 significantly from the conservator's plan. The plan must be based on the needs of the 15 individual subject to conservatorship and take into account the best interest of the 16 individual as well as the individual's preferences, values, and prior directions, to the 17 extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the conservator. The conservator shall 18 include in the plan 19 (1) a budget containing projected expenses and resources, including an 20 estimate of the total amount of fees the conservator anticipates charging each year and 21 a statement or list of the amount the conservator proposes to charge for each service 22 the conservator anticipates providing to the individual; 23 (2) how the conservator will involve the individual in decisions about 24 management of the conservatorship estate; 25 (3) any step the conservator plans to take to develop or restore the 26 ability of the individual to manage the conservatorship estate; and 27 (4) an estimate of the duration of the conservatorship. 28 (b) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of the conservator's plan under 29 (a) of this section, together with a copy of the plan, to the individual subject to 30 conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent 31 order, and any other person the court determines. The notice must include a statement 01 of the right to object to the plan and be given not later than 14 days after the filing. 02 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship and any person entitled to receive 03 notice and a copy of the plan of the conservator under (b) of this section may object to 04 the plan. 05 (d) The court shall review the plan of the conservator filed under (a) of this 06 section and determine whether to approve the plan or require a new plan. In deciding 07 whether to approve the plan, the court shall consider an objection under (c) of this 08 section and whether the plan is consistent with the duties and powers of the 09 conservator. The court may not approve the plan until 30 days after its filing. 10 (e) After a conservator's plan under this section is approved by the court, the 11 conservator shall provide a copy of the plan to the individual subject to 12 conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent 13 order, and any other person the court determines. 14 Sec. 13.29.250. Inventory; records. (a) Not later than 60 days after 15 appointment, a conservator shall prepare and file with the appointing court a detailed 16 inventory of the conservatorship estate, together with an oath or affirmation that the 17 inventory is believed to be complete and accurate as far as information permits. 18 (b) A conservator shall give notice of the filing of an inventory to the 19 individual subject to conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under 20 AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent order, and any other person the court determines. The 21 notice must be given not later than 14 days after the filing. 22 (c) A conservator shall keep records of the administration of the 23 conservatorship estate and make them available for examination on reasonable request 24 of the individual subject to conservatorship, a guardian for the individual, or any other 25 person the conservator or the court determines. 26 Sec. 13.29.255. Administrative powers of conservator not requiring court 27 approval. (a) Except as otherwise provided in AS 13.29.220 or qualified or limited in 28 the court's order of appointment and stated in the letters of office, a conservator has all 29 powers granted in this section and any additional power granted to a trustee by a law 30 of this state other than this chapter. 31 (b) A conservator, acting reasonably and consistent with the fiduciary duties 01 of the conservator to accomplish the purpose of the conservatorship, without specific 02 court authorization or confirmation, may, with respect to the conservatorship estate, 03 (1) collect, hold, and retain property, including property in which the 04 conservator has a personal interest and real property in another state, until the 05 conservator determines disposition of the property should be made; 06 (2) receive additions to the conservatorship estate; 07 (3) continue or participate in the operation of a business or other 08 enterprise; 09 (4) acquire an undivided interest in property in which the conservator, 10 in a fiduciary capacity, holds an undivided interest;

Distribution from conservatorship estate. (a) Except as 16 otherwise provided in AS 13.29.220 or qualified or limited in the court's order of 17 appointment and stated in the letters of office, and unless contrary to a plan of the 18 conservator under AS 13.29.245, the conservator may expend or distribute income or 19 principal of the conservatorship estate without specific court authorization or 20 confirmation for the support, care, education, health, or welfare of the individual 21 subject to conservatorship or an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual 22 subject to conservatorship, including the payment of child or spousal support, in 23 accordance with (b) - (e) of this section. 24 (b) The conservator shall consider a recommendation relating to the 25 appropriate standard of support, care, education, health, or welfare for the individual 26 subject to conservatorship or individual who is dependent on the individual subject to 27 conservatorship, made by a guardian for the individual subject to conservatorship, if 28 any, and, if the individual subject to conservatorship is a minor, a recommendation 29 made by a parent of the minor. 30 (c) The conservator acting in compliance with the conservator's duties under 31 AS 13.29.240 is not liable for an expenditure or distribution made based on a 01 recommendation under (b) of this section unless the conservator knows the 02 expenditure or distribution is not in the best interest of the individual subject to 03 conservatorship. 04 (d) In making an expenditure or distribution under this section, the conservator 05 shall consider 06 (1) the size of the conservatorship estate, the estimated duration of the 07 conservatorship, and the likelihood the individual subject to conservatorship, at some 08 future time, may be fully self-sufficient and able to manage the individual's financial 09 affairs and the conservatorship estate; 10 (2) the accustomed standard of living of the individual subject to 11 conservatorship and individual who is dependent on the individual subject to 12 conservatorship; 13 (3) other funds or source used for the support of the individual subject 14 to conservatorship; and 15 (4) the preferences, values, and prior directions of the individual 16 subject to conservatorship. 17 (e) Funds expended or distributed under this section may be paid by the 18 conservator to any person, including the individual subject to conservatorship, as 19 reimbursement for expenditures the conservator might have made, or in advance for 20 services to be provided to the individual subject to conservatorship or individual who 21 is dependent on the individual subject to conservatorship if it is reasonable to expect 22 the services will be performed and advance payment is customary or reasonably 23 necessary under the circumstances. 24 Sec. 13.29.265. Conservator's report and accounting; monitoring. (a) A 25 conservator shall file with the court a report in a record regarding the administration of 26 the conservatorship estate annually unless the court otherwise directs, on resignation 27 or removal, on termination of the conservatorship, and at any other time the court 28 directs. 29 (b) A report under (a) of this section must state or contain 30 (1) an accounting that lists property included in the conservatorship 31 estate and the receipts, disbursements, liabilities, and distributions during the period 01 for which the report is made; 02 (2) a list of the services provided to the individual subject to 03 conservatorship; 04 (3) a copy of the most recently approved plan of the conservator and a 05 statement whether the conservator has deviated from the plan and, if so, how the 06 conservator has deviated and why; 07 (4) a recommendation as to the need for continued conservatorship and 08 any recommended change in the scope of the conservatorship; 09 (5) to the extent feasible, a copy of the most recent reasonably 10 available financial statements evidencing the status of bank accounts, investment 11 accounts, and mortgages or other debts of the individual subject to conservatorship 12 with all but the last four digits of the account numbers and Social Security number 13 redacted; 14 (6) anything of more than minimal value that the conservator, any 15 individual who resides with the conservator, or the spouse, parent, child, or sibling of 16 the conservator has received from a person providing goods or services to the 17 individual subject to conservatorship; 18 (7) any business relation the conservator has with a person the 19 conservator has paid or that has benefited from the property of the individual subject 20 to conservatorship; and 21 (8) whether any co-conservator or successor conservator appointed to 22 serve when a designated event occurs is alive and able to serve. 23 (c) The court may appoint a visitor to review a report under this section or the 24 plan of the conservator under AS 13.29.245, interview the individual subject to 25 conservatorship or conservator, or investigate any other matter involving the 26 conservatorship. In connection with the report, the court may order the conservator to 27 submit the conservatorship estate to appropriate examination in a manner the court 28 directs. 29 (d) Notice of the filing under this section of a conservator's report, together 30 with a copy of the report, must be provided to the individual subject to 31 conservatorship, a person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent 01 order, and other persons the court determines. The notice and report must be given not 02 later than 14 days after filing. 03 (e) The court shall establish procedures for monitoring a report submitted 04 under this section and review each report at least annually to determine whether 05 (1) the reports provide sufficient information to establish the 06 conservator has complied with the conservator's duties; 07 (2) the conservatorship should continue; and 08 (3) the requested fees of the conservator, if any, should be approved. 09 (f) If the court determines there is reason to believe a conservator has not 10 complied with the conservator's duties or the conservatorship should not continue, the 11 court 12 (1) shall notify the individual subject to conservatorship, the 13 conservator, and any other person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a 14 subsequent order; 15 (2) may require additional information from the conservator; 16 (3) may appoint a visitor to interview the individual subject to 17 conservatorship or conservator or investigate any matter involving the 18 conservatorship; and 19 (4) consistent with AS 13.29.300 and 13.29.305, may hold a hearing to 20 consider removal of the conservator, termination of the conservatorship, or a change in 21 the powers granted to the conservator or terms of the conservatorship. 22 (g) If the court has reason to believe fees requested by a conservator are not 23 reasonable, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to adjust the requested 24 fees. 25 (h) A conservator may petition the court for approval of a report filed under 26 this section. The court after review may approve the report. If the court approves the 27 report, there is a rebuttable presumption the report is accurate as to a matter adequately 28 disclosed in the report. 29 (i) An order, after notice and hearing, approving an interim report of a 30 conservator filed under this section adjudicates liabilities concerning a matter 31 adequately disclosed in the report, as to a person given notice of the report or 01 accounting. 02 (j) An order, after notice and hearing, approving a final report filed under this 03 section discharges the conservator from all liabilities, claims, and causes of action by a 04 person given notice of the report and the hearing as to a matter adequately disclosed in 05 the report. 06 Sec. 13.29.270. Attempted transfer of property by individual subject to 07 conservatorship. (a) The interest of an individual subject to conservatorship in 08 property included in the conservatorship estate is not transferrable or assignable by the 09 individual and is not subject to levy, garnishment, or similar process for claims against 10 the individual unless allowed under AS 13.29.290. 11 (b) If an individual subject to conservatorship enters into a contract after 12 having the right to enter the contract removed by the court, the contract is void against 13 the individual and the property of the individual but is enforceable against the person 14 that contracted with the individual. 15 (c) A person other than the conservator that deals with an individual subject to 16 conservatorship with respect to property included in the conservatorship estate is 17 entitled to protection provided by law of this state other than this chapter. 18 Sec. 13.29.275. Transaction involving conflict of interest. A transaction 19 involving a conservatorship estate which is affected by a substantial conflict between 20 the conservator's fiduciary duties and personal interests is voidable unless the 21 transaction is authorized by court order after notice to persons entitled to notice under 22 AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent order. A transaction affected by a substantial conflict 23 includes a sale, encumbrance, or other transaction involving the conservatorship estate 24 entered into by the conservator, an individual with whom the conservator resides, the 25 spouse, descendant, sibling, agent, or attorney of the conservator, or a corporation or 26 other enterprise in which the conservator has a substantial beneficial interest. 27 Sec. 13.29.280. Protection of person dealing with conservator. (a) A person 28 that assists or deals with a conservator in good faith and for value in any transaction, 29 other than a transaction requiring a court order under AS 13.29.220, is protected as 30 though the conservator properly exercised any power in question. Knowledge by a 31 person that the person is dealing with a conservator alone does not require the person 01 to inquire into the existence of authority of the conservator or the propriety of the 02 conservator's exercise of authority, but restrictions on authority stated in letters of 03 office, or otherwise provided by law, are effective as to the person. A person that pays 04 or delivers property to a conservator is not responsible for proper application of the 05 property. 06 (b) Protection under (a) of this section extends to a procedural irregularity or 07 jurisdictional defect in the proceeding leading to the issuance of letters of office and 08 does not substitute for protection for a person that assists or deals with a conservator 09 provided by comparable provisions in law of this state other than this chapter relating 10 to a commercial transaction or simplifying a transfer of securities by a fiduciary. 11 Sec. 13.29.285. Death of individual subject to conservatorship. (a) If an 12 individual subject to conservatorship dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for 13 safekeeping any will of the individual in the possession of the conservator and inform 14 the personal representative named in the will if feasible, or if not feasible, a 15 beneficiary named in the will, of the delivery. 16 (b) On the death of an individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator 17 shall conclude the administration of the conservatorship estate as provided in (c) of 18 this section and AS 13.29.305. 19 (c) If, after 40 days from the death of the individual subject to 20 conservatorship, no other person has been appointed personal representative and no 21 application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator of the 22 individual on the date of the individual's death may apply to exercise the powers and 23 duties of a personal representative in order to proceed with administering and 24 distributing the decedent's estate without additional or further appointment. Upon 25 application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a 26 conservator, after notice to any person demanding notice under AS 13.16.070 and to 27 any person nominated executor in any will of which the applicant is aware, the court 28 may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection, and 29 endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the individual formerly subject to 30 conservatorship is deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers 31 and duties of a personal representative. The making and entry of an order under this 01 subsection has the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as 02 provided in AS 13.16.115 and 13.16.245 - 13.16.655 except that estate in the name of 03 the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent's successors 04 without prior retransfer to the conservator as personal representative. 05 Sec. 13.29.290. Presentation and allowance of claim. (a) A conservator may 06 pay, or secure by encumbering property included in the conservatorship estate, a claim 07 against the conservatorship estate or the individual subject to conservatorship arising 08 before or during the conservatorship, on presentation and allowance in accordance 09 with the priorities under (d) of this section. A claimant may present a claim by 10 (1) sending or delivering to the conservator a statement in a record of 11 the claim, indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount 12 claimed; or 13 (2) filing the claim with the court, in a form acceptable to the court, 14 and sending or delivering a copy of the claim to the conservator. 15 (b) A claim under (a) of this section is presented on receipt by the conservator 16 of the statement of the claim or the filing with the court of the claim, whichever first 17 occurs. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed in whole or in part by the 18 conservator in a record sent or delivered to the claimant not later than 60 days after its 19 presentation. Before payment, the conservator may change an allowance of the claim 20 to a disallowance in whole or in part, but not after allowance under a court order or 21 order directing payment of the claim. Presentation of a claim tolls until 30 days after 22 disallowance of the claim the running of a statute of limitations that has not expired 23 relating to the claim. 24 (c) A claimant whose claim under (a) of this section has not been paid may 25 petition the court to determine the claim at any time before it is barred by a statute of 26 limitations, and the court may order its allowance, payment, or security by 27 encumbering property included in the conservatorship estate. If a proceeding is 28 pending against the individual subject to conservatorship at the time of appointment of 29 the conservator or is initiated thereafter, the moving party shall give the conservator 30 notice of the proceeding if it could result in creating a claim against the 31 conservatorship estate. 01 (d) If a conservatorship estate is likely to be exhausted before all existing 02 claims are paid, the conservator shall distribute the estate in money or in kind in 03 payment of claims in the following order: 04 (1) costs and expenses of administration; 05 (2) a claim of the federal or state government having priority under law 06 other than this chapter; 07 (3) a claim incurred by the conservator for support, care, education, 08 health, or welfare previously provided to the individual subject to conservatorship or 09 an individual who is in fact dependent on the individual subject to conservatorship; 10 (4) a claim arising before the conservatorship; and 11 (5) all other claims. 12 (e) Preference may not be given in the payment of a claim under (d) of this 13 section over another claim of the same class. A claim due and payable may not be 14 preferred over a claim not due unless 15 (1) doing so would leave the conservatorship estate without sufficient 16 funds to pay the basic living and health care expenses of the individual subject to 17 conservatorship; and 18 (2) the court authorizes the preference under AS 13.29.220(a)(8). 19 (f) If assets of a conservatorship estate are adequate to meet all existing 20 claims, the court may order the conservator to grant a security interest in the 21 conservatorship estate for payment of a claim at a future date if it is in the best interest 22 of the individual subject to conservatorship. 23 Sec. 13.29.295. Personal liability of conservator. (a) Except as otherwise 24 agreed by a conservator, the conservator is not personally liable on a contract properly 25 entered into in a fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the 26 conservatorship estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the conservator's 27 representative capacity in the contract or before entering into the contract. 28 (b) A conservator is personally liable for an obligation arising from control of 29 property of the conservatorship estate or an act or omission occurring in the course of 30 administration of the conservatorship estate only if the conservator is personally at 31 fault. 01 (c) A claim based on a contract entered into by a conservator in a fiduciary 02 capacity, an obligation arising from control of property included in the 03 conservatorship estate, or a tort committed in the course of administration of the 04 conservatorship estate may be asserted against the conservatorship estate in a 05 proceeding against the conservator in a fiduciary capacity, whether or not the 06 conservator is personally liable for the claim. 07 (d) A question of liability between a conservatorship estate and the 08 conservator personally may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge, 09 or indemnification or another appropriate proceeding or action. 10 Sec. 13.29.300. Removal of conservator; appointment of successor. (a) The 11 court may remove a conservator for failure to perform the duties of the conservator or 12 other good cause and appoint a successor conservator to assume the duties of the 13 conservator. 14 (b) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether to remove a 15 conservator and appoint a successor on 16 (1) petition of the individual subject to conservatorship, conservator, or 17 person interested in the welfare of the individual which contains allegations that, if 18 true, would support a reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and 19 appointment of a successor may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a 20 hearing if a petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed during 21 the preceding six months; 22 (2) communication from the individual subject to conservatorship, 23 conservator, or person interested in the welfare of the individual which supports a 24 reasonable belief that removal of the conservator and appointment of a successor may 25 be appropriate; or 26 (3) determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best 27 interest of the individual subject to conservatorship. 28 (c) Notice of a petition under (b)(1) of this section must be given to the 29 individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, and any other person the court 30 determines. 31 (d) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to remove the 01 conservator and have a successor appointed has the right to choose an attorney to 02 represent the individual in this matter. If the individual is not represented by an 03 attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions as in 04 AS 13.29.180. The court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as 05 provided in AS 13.29.490. 06 (e) In selecting a successor conservator, the court shall follow the priorities 07 under AS 13.29.200. 08 (f) Not later than 30 days after appointing a successor conservator, the court 09 shall give notice of the appointment to the individual subject to conservatorship and 10 any person entitled to notice under AS 13.29.205(e) or a subsequent order. 11 Sec. 13.29.305. Termination or modification of conservatorship. (a) A 12 conservatorship for a minor terminates on the earliest of 13 (1) a court order terminating the conservatorship; 14 (2) the minor becoming an adult or, if the minor consents or the court 15 finds by clear and convincing evidence that substantial harm to the minor's interests is 16 otherwise likely, attaining 21 years of age; 17 (3) emancipation of the minor; or 18 (4) death of the minor. 19 (b) A conservatorship for an adult terminates on order of the court or when the 20 adult dies. 21 (c) An individual subject to conservatorship, the conservator, or a person 22 interested in the welfare of the individual may petition for 23 (1) termination of the conservatorship on the ground that a basis for 24 appointment under AS 13.29.155 does not exist or termination would be in the best 25 interest of the individual or for other good cause; or 26 (2) modification of the conservatorship on the ground that the extent of 27 protection or assistance granted is not appropriate or for other good cause. 28 (d) The court shall hold a hearing to determine whether termination or 29 modification of a conservatorship is appropriate on 30 (1) petition under (c) of this section which contains allegations that, if 31 true, would support a reasonable belief that termination or modification of the 01 conservatorship may be appropriate, but the court may decline to hold a hearing if a 02 petition based on the same or substantially similar facts was filed within the preceding 03 six months; 04 (2) a communication from the individual subject to conservatorship, 05 conservator, or person interested in the welfare of the individual which supports a 06 reasonable belief that termination or modification of the conservatorship may be 07 appropriate, including because the functional needs of the individual or supports or 08 services available to the individual have changed; 09 (3) a report from a guardian or conservator which indicates that 10 termination or modification may be appropriate because the functional needs or 11 supports or services available to the individual have changed or a protective 12 arrangement instead of conservatorship or other less restrictive alternative is available; 13 or 14 (4) a determination by the court that a hearing would be in the best 15 interest of the individual. 16 (e) Notice of a petition under (c) of this section must be given to the individual 17 subject to conservatorship, the conservator, and any other person the court determines. 18 (f) On presentation of prima facie evidence for termination of a 19 conservatorship, the court shall order termination unless it is proven that a basis for 20 appointment of a conservator under AS 13.29.155 exists. 21 (g) The court shall modify the powers granted to a conservator if the powers 22 are excessive or inadequate because of a change in the abilities or limitations of the 23 individual subject to conservatorship, the supports of the individual, or other 24 circumstances. 25 (h) Unless the court otherwise orders for good cause, before terminating a 26 conservatorship, the court shall follow the same procedures to safeguard the rights of 27 the individual subject to conservatorship which apply to a petition for conservatorship. 28 (i) An individual subject to conservatorship who seeks to terminate or modify 29 the terms of the conservatorship has the right to choose an attorney to represent the 30 individual in this matter. If the individual is not represented by an attorney, the court 31 shall appoint an attorney under the same conditions as in AS 13.29.180. The court 01 shall award reasonable attorney fees to the attorney as provided in AS 13.29.490. 02 (j) On termination of a conservatorship other than because of the death of the 03 individual subject to conservatorship, property of the conservatorship estate passes to 04 the individual. The order of termination must direct the conservator to file a final 05 report and petition for discharge on approval by the court of the final report. 06 (k) On termination of a conservatorship because of the death of the individual 07 subject to conservatorship, the conservator shall promptly file a final report and 08 petition for discharge on approval by the court of the final report. On approval of the 09 final report, the conservator shall proceed expeditiously to distribute the 10 conservatorship estate to the individual's estate or as otherwise ordered by the court. 11 The conservator may take reasonable measures necessary to preserve the 12 conservatorship estate until distribution can be made. 13 (l) The court shall issue a final order of discharge on the approval by the court 14 of the final report and satisfaction by the conservator of any other condition the court 15 imposed on the conservator's discharge. 16 Sec. 13.29.310. Payment of debt and delivery of property to foreign 17 conservator without local proceedings. (a) Any person indebted to or having 18 possession of property or of an instrument evidencing a debt, stock, or chose in action 19 belonging to an individual subject to conservatorship under the law of another state 20 may pay or deliver to a conservator, guardian of the estate, or other like fiduciary 21 appointed by a court of the state of residence of the individual, upon being presented 22 with proof of the fiduciary's appointment and an affidavit made by the fiduciary or on 23 the fiduciary's behalf stating: 24 (1) that no protective proceeding relating to the individual is pending 25 in this state; and 26 (2) that the foreign conservator is entitled to payment or to receive 27 delivery. 28 (b) If the person to whom the affidavit is presented is not aware of any 29 protective proceeding pending in this state, payment or delivery in response to the 30 demand and affidavit discharges the debtor or possessor. 31 Sec. 13.29.315. Transfer for benefit of minor without appointment of 01 conservator. (a) Unless a person required to transfer funds or other property to a 02 minor knows that a conservator for the minor has been appointed or a proceeding is 03 pending for conservatorship, the person may transfer an amount or value not 04 exceeding $15,000 in a 12-month period to 05 (1) a person that has care or custody of the minor and with whom the 06 minor resides; 07 (2) a guardian for the minor; 08 (3) a custodian under AS 13.46 (Alaska Uniform Transfers to Minors 09 Act); or 10 (4) a financial institution as a deposit in an interest-bearing account or 11 certificate solely in the name of the minor and shall give notice to the minor of the 12 deposit. 13 (b) A person that transfers funds or other property under this section is not 14 responsible for its proper application. 15 (c) A person that receives funds or other property for a minor under (a)(1) or 16 (2) of this section may apply it only to the support, care, education, health, or welfare 17 of the minor, and may not derive a personal financial benefit from it, except for 18 reimbursement for necessary expenses. Funds not applied for these purposes must be 19 preserved for the future support, care, education, health, or welfare of the minor, and 20 the balance, if any, transferred to the minor when the minor becomes an adult or 21 otherwise is emancipated. 22 Article 4. Other Protective Arrangements. 23 Sec. 13.29.320. Authority for protective arrangement. (a) Under 24 AS 13.29.320 - 13.29.375, a court on receiving a petition for a 25 (1) guardianship for an adult may order a protective arrangement 26 instead of guardianship as a less restrictive alternative to guardianship; and 27 (2) conservatorship for an individual may order a protective 28 arrangement instead of conservatorship as a less restrictive alternative to 29 conservatorship. 30 (b) A person interested in an adult's welfare, including the adult or a 31 conservator for the adult, may petition under AS 13.29.320 - 13.29.375 for a 01 protective arrangement instead of guardianship. 02 (c) The following persons may petition under AS 13.29.320 - 13.29.375 for a 03 protective arrangement instead of conservatorship: 04 (1) the individual for whom the protective arrangement is sought; 05 (2) a person interested in the property, financial affairs, or welfare of 06 the individual, including a person that would be adversely affected by lack of effective 07 management of property or financial affairs of the individual; and 08 (3) the guardian for the individual. 09 Sec. 13.29.325. Basis for protective arrangement instead of guardianship 10 for adult.
