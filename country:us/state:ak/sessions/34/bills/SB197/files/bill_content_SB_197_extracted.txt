The 04 instruction may occur outside of regular school hours as necessary. The instruction 05 must 06 (1) use evidence-based practices, including clear explanations of 07 concepts, modeling strategies, and immediate feedback to a student; 08 (2) include targeted individual or small-group mathematics instruction 09 and activities; and 10 (3) continuously monitor the student's progress in mathematics and 11 provide data for teachers to adjust instruction according to the student's needs. 12 (b) The district shall implement a mathematics improvement plan required 13 under (a) of this section not later than 10 days after receiving a student's below- 14 proficient test score. The district shall create the plan in cooperation with the student's 15 mathematics teachers, the school principal, other applicable school personnel, and the 16 student's parent or guardian. The plan must include a description of the evidence- 17 based mathematics intervention instruction and activities in which the student will 18 participate. A plan must be in effect until the student demonstrates mathematical 19 proficiency in all skills in which the student did not previously achieve a score of 20 proficiency.
