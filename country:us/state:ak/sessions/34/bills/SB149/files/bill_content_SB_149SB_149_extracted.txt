A load-serving entity is exempt from compliance 09 with the renewable portfolio standard if the aggregate percentage of electricity 10 generated from renewable energy resources by all load-serving entities on the 11 interconnected electric energy transmission network, adjusted according to 12 AS 42.05.905, meets or exceeds the aggregate renewable portfolio standard for those 13 entities. 14 Sec. 42.05.925. Definitions. In AS 42.05.900 - 42.05.925, 15 (1) "compliance period" means each period identified in AS 42.05.900; 16 (2) "distributed energy system" means a community energy facility as 17 that term is defined in AS 42.05.735 or a renewable energy resource that is located on 18 any property owned or leased by a customer within the service territory of the load- 19 serving entity that is interconnected on the customer's side of the utility meter; 20 (3) "interconnected electric energy transmission network" has the 21 meaning given in AS 42.05.790; 22 (4) "load-serving entity" has the meaning given in AS 42.05.790; 23 (5) "megawatt hour" means 1,000,000 watts of electricity being used in 24 one hour and includes the steam equivalent of a megawatt hour; 25 (6) "renewable electricity" means electricity or energy generated from 26 renewable energy resources; 27 (7) "renewable electricity credit" means one credit equal to the 28 generation attributes of one megawatt hour that is derived from a renewable energy 29 resource; where fossil and renewable fuels are co-fired in the same generating unit, the 30 unit is considered to generate renewable electricity in direct proportion to the 31 percentage of the total heat input value represented by the heat input value of the 01 renewable fuels; 02 (8) "renewable energy resource" means a resource, other than 03 petroleum, nuclear, natural gas, or coal, that naturally replenishes over a human, not a 04 geological, time frame, is ultimately derived from solar power, water power, or wind 05 power, comes from the sun or from thermal inertia of the earth, and minimizes the 06 output of toxic material in the conversion of the energy; in this paragraph, "resource" 07 includes 08 (A) solar and solar thermal energy, wind energy, and kinetic 09 energy of moving water, including 10 (i) waves, tides, or currents; 11 (ii) run-of-river hydropower, in-river hydrokinetic; 12 (iii) conventional hydropower, lake tap hydropower; 13 (iv) water released through a dam; and 14 (v) geothermal energy; 15 (B) waste to energy systems, including 16 (i) wood; 17 (ii) landfill gas produced by municipal solid waste or 18 fuel that has been manufactured in whole or significant part from 19 waste; 20 (iii) biofuels produced in the state; and 21 (iv) thermal energy produced from a geothermal heat 22 pump using municipal solid waste, including biogenic and 23 anthropogenic factions. 24 (9) "renewable portfolio standard" means the percentage of electricity 25 in a load-serving entity's portfolio that must be generated from renewable energy 26 resources under AS 42.05.900, adjusted according to AS 42.05.905. 27 * Sec. 6. AS 42.45.110(a) is amended to read: 28 (a) The costs used to calculate the amount of power cost equalization for all 29 electric utilities eligible under AS 42.45.100 - 42.45.150 include all allowable costs, 30 except return on equity, used by the commission to determine the revenue requirement 31 for electric utilities subject to rate regulation under AS 42.05. The costs used in 01 determining the power cost equalization per kilowatt-hour shall exclude any other type 02 of assistance that reduces the customer's costs of power on a kilowatt-hour basis and 03 that is provided to the electric utility within 60 days before the commission determines 04 the power cost equalization per kilowatt-hour of the electric utility. In calculating 05 power cost equalization, the commission may not consider validated costs or kilowatt- 06 hour sales associated with a United States Department of Defense facility, revenue 07 from the sale of recovered heat, or revenue from the sale of renewable electricity 08 credits acquired under AS 42.05.910. 09 * Sec. 7. AS 42.05.785(c)(3) is repealed December 31, 2030. 10 * Sec. 8. This Act takes effect July 1, 2025.
