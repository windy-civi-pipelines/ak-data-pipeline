The administrator of the coordinated licensure 02 information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions. 03 (4) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require 04 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. 05 Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and 06 testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be 07 enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the 08 practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings 09 pending before it.

Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the Commission 20 shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact or 21 promulgated rules. 22 (b) Default, Technical Assistance and Termination 23 (1) If the Commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the 24 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the 25 promulgated rules, the Commission shall: 26 (A) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other 27 party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the 28 default or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and 29 (B) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance 30 regarding the default. 31 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's 01 membership in this Compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority 02 of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact 03 may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not 04 relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of 05 default. 06 (3) Termination of membership in this Compact shall be imposed only 07 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to 08 suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor of the 09 defaulting state and to the executive officer of the defaulting state's licensing board 10 and each of the party states. 11 (4) A state whose membership in this Compact has been terminated is 12 responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the 13 effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective 14 date of termination. 15 (5) The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is 16 found to be in default or whose membership in this Compact has been terminated 17 unless agreed upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting state. 18 (6) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Commission by 19 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in 20 which the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded 21 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees. 22 (c) Dispute Resolution 23 (1) Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall attempt to 24 resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among party states and between 25 party and non-party states. 26 (2) The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both 27 mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate. 28 (3) In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes among party 29 states arising under this Compact: 30 (A) The party states may submit the issues in dispute to an 31 arbitration panel, which will be comprised of individuals appointed by the 01 Compact administrator in each of the affected party states and an individual 02 mutually agreed upon by the Compact administrators of all the party states 03 involved in the dispute. 04 (B) The decision of a majority of the arbitrators shall be final 05 and binding. 06 (d) Enforcement 07 (1) The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall 08 enforce the provisions and rules of this Compact. 09 (2) By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal action in the 10 U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district in which the 11 Commission has its principal offices against a party state that is in default to enforce 12 compliance with the provisions of this Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. 13 The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial 14 enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 15 litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees. 16 (3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the 17 Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal 18 or state law. 19 ARTICLE X 20 Effective Date, Withdrawal and Amendment 21 (a) This Compact shall become effective and binding on the earlier of the date 22 of legislative enactment of this Compact into law by no less than twenty-six (26) states 23 or December 31, 2018.

A party state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six (6) months 01 after enactment of the repealing statute. 02 (d) A party state's withdrawal or termination shall not affect the continuing 03 requirement of the withdrawing or terminated state's licensing board to report adverse 04 actions and significant investigations occurring prior to the effective date of such 05 withdrawal or termination. 06 (e) Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate or 07 prevent any nurse licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a 08 party state and a non-party state that is made in accordance with the other provisions 09 of this Compact. 10 (f) This Compact may be amended by the party states. No amendment to this 11 Compact shall become effective and binding upon the party states unless and until it is 12 enacted into the laws of all party states. 13 (g) Representatives of non-party states to this Compact shall be invited to 14 participate in the activities of the Commission, on a nonvoting basis, prior to the 15 adoption of this Compact by all states. 16 ARTICLE XI 17 Construction and Severability 18 This Compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 19 thereof. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, 20 sentence or provision of this Compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of 21 any party state or of the United States, or if the applicability thereof to any 22 government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the 23 remainder of this Compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, 24 person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

19 (2) Violations of nurse licensure and other laws regulating the practice 20 of nursing may result in injury or harm to the public; 21 (3) The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of advanced 22 communication technologies as part of our nation's health care delivery system require 23 greater coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of nurse licensure and 24 regulation; 25 (4) New practice modalities and technology make compliance with 26 individual state nurse licensure laws difficult and complex; 27 (5) The current system of duplicative licensure for nurses practicing in 28 multiple states is cumbersome and redundant for both nurses and states; and 29 (6) Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements throughout the states 30 promotes public safety and public health benefits. 31 (b) The general purposes of this Compact are to: 01 (1) Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect the public's health and 02 safety; 03 (2) Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party states in the areas of 04 nurse licensure and regulation; 05 (3) Facilitate the exchange of information between party states in the 06 areas of nurse regulation, investigation and adverse actions; 07 (4) Promote compliance with the laws governing the practice of 08 nursing in each jurisdiction; 09 (5) Invest all party states with the authority to hold a nurse accountable 10 for meeting all state practice laws in the state in which the patient is located at the time 11 care is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state licenses; 12 (6) Decrease redundancies in the consideration and issuance of nurse 13 licenses; and 14 (7) Provide opportunities for interstate practice by nurses who meet 15 uniform licensure requirements. 16 ARTICLE II 17 Definitions 18 As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction, 19 (1) "Adverse action" means any administrative, civil, equitable or 20 criminal action permitted by a state's laws which is imposed by a licensing board or 21 other authority against a nurse, including actions against an individual's license or 22 multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, monitoring of 23 the licensee, limitation on the licensee's practice, or any other encumbrance on 24 licensure affecting a nurse's authorization to practice, including issuance of a cease 25 and desist action. 26 (2) "Alternative program" means a non-disciplinary monitoring 27 program approved by a licensing board. 28 (3) "Coordinated licensure information system" means an integrated 29 process for collecting, storing and sharing information on nurse licensure and 30 enforcement activities related to nurse licensure laws that is administered by a 31 nonprofit organization composed of and controlled by licensing boards. 01 (4) "Current significant investigative information" means: 02 (A) Investigative information that a licensing board, after a 03 preliminary inquiry that includes notification and an opportunity for the nurse 04 to respond, if required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, 05 if proved true, would indicate more than a minor infraction;

Nothing in this 06 Compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a 07 single-state license. 08 (g) Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on the effective date of 09 this Compact, may retain and renew the multistate license issued by the nurse's then- 10 current home state, provided that: 11 (1) A nurse, who changes primary state of residence after this 12 Compact's effective date, must meet all applicable Article III.c. requirements to obtain 13 a multistate license from a new home state. 14 (2) A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate licensure requirements in 15 Article III.c. due to a disqualifying event occurring after this Compact's effective date 16 shall be ineligible to retain or renew a multistate license, and the nurse's multistate 17 license shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with applicable rules adopted by 18 the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators 19 ("Commission"). 20 ARTICLE IV 21 Applications for Licensure in a Party State 22 (a) Upon application for a multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing 23 party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, 24 whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license issued by any other 25 state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure 26 privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any 27 license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant and whether the 28 applicant is currently participating in an alternative program. 29 (b) A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the home state, in only 30 one party state at a time. 31 (c) If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party 01 states, the nurse must apply for licensure in the new home state, and the multistate 02 license issued by the prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with 03 applicable rules adopted by the Commission. 04 (1) The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in 05 primary state of residence. 06 (2) A multistate license shall not be issued by the new home state until 07 the nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to 08 the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate 09 license from the new home state. 10 (d) If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state 11 to a non-party state, the multistate license issued by the prior home state will convert 12 to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state. 13 ARTICLE V 14 Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing Boards 15 (a) In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, a licensing board 16 shall have the authority to: 17 (1) Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege 18 to practice within that party state. 19 (A) Only the home state shall have the power to take adverse 20 action against a nurse's license issued by the home state. 21 (B) For purposes of taking adverse action, the home state 22 licensing board shall give the same priority and effect to reported conduct 23 received from a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred within 24 the home state. In so doing, the home state shall apply its own state laws to 25 determine appropriate action. 26 (2) Issue cease and desist orders or impose an encumbrance on a 27 nurse's authority to practice within that party state. 28 (3) Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who changes 29 primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing 30 board shall also have the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall promptly 31 report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated 01 licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure 02 information system shall promptly notify the new home state of any such actions. 03 (4) Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require 04 the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. 05 Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for the attendance and 06 testimony of witnesses or the production of evidence from another party state shall be 07 enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to the 08 practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings 09 pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, 10 mileage and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the 11 witnesses or evidence are located. 12 (5) Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure applicant, fingerprint 13 or other biometric-based information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 14 criminal background checks, receive the results of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 15 record search on criminal background checks and use the results in making licensure 16 decisions. 17 (6) If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected nurse 18 the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action 19 taken against that nurse. 20 (7) Take adverse action based on the factual findings of the remote 21 state, provided that the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such 22 adverse action. 23 (b) If adverse action is taken by the home state against a nurse's multistate 24 license, the nurse's multistate licensure privilege to practice in all other party states 25 shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the multistate 26 license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against a nurse's 27 multistate license shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate licensure 28 privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order. Nothing in 29 this Compact shall override a party state's decision that participation in an alternative 30 program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall 31 deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any nurse 01 for the duration of the nurse's participation in an alternative program. 02 ARTICLE VI 03 Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of Information 04 (a) All party states shall participate in a coordinated licensure information 05 system of all licensed registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses 06 (LPNs/VNs).

If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the 10 approval of the Commission. 11 ARTICLE IX 12 Oversight, Dispute Resolution and Enforcement 13 (a) Oversight 14 (1) Each party state shall enforce this Compact and take all actions 15 necessary and appropriate to effectuate this Compact's purposes and intent. 16 (2) The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in 17 any proceeding that may affect the powers, responsibilities or actions of the 18 Commission, and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 19 purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such proceeding to the Commission 20 shall render a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact or 21 promulgated rules. 22 (b) Default, Technical Assistance and Termination 23 (1) If the Commission determines that a party state has defaulted in the 24 performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact or the 25 promulgated rules, the Commission shall: 26 (A) Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other 27 party states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the 28 default or any other action to be taken by the Commission; and 29 (B) Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance 30 regarding the default. 31 (2) If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state's 01 membership in this Compact may be terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority 02 of the administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this Compact 03 may be terminated on the effective date of termination.
