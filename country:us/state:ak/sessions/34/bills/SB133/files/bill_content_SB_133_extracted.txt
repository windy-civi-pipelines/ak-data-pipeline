The 06 application programming interface must support the exchange of prior authorization 07 requests and determinations for medical care and prescription drugs, including 08 information on covered alternative prescription drugs. The application programming 09 interface must indicate that a prior authorization denial, an authorization of medical 10 care less intensive than the medical care included in the original request, or an 11 authorization of a prescription drug other than the one included in the original prior 12 authorization request is an adverse benefit determination and is subject to the health 13 care insurer's grievance and appeal process under AS 21.07.005. 14 Sec. 21.07.160. Step therapy restrictions and exceptions. (a) A health care 15 insurer that provides coverage under a health care insurance policy for the treatment of 16 Stage 4 advanced metastatic cancer may not limit or exclude coverage under the health 17 benefit plan for a drug that is approved by the United States Food and Drug 18 Administration and that is on the insurer's prescription drug formulary by mandating 19 that a covered person with Stage 4 advanced metastatic cancer undergo step therapy if 20 the use of the approved drug is an approved indication by the United States Food and 21 Drug Administration or on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Drugs and 22 Biologics Compendium as an indication for the treatment of Stage 4 advanced 23 metastatic cancer consistent with Category 1 or Category 2A of evidence and 24 consensus or peer-reviewed medical literature. 25 (b) If coverage of a prescription drug for the treatment of any medical 26 condition is restricted by a health care insurer or utilization review organization 27 because of a step therapy protocol, the health care insurer or utilization review 28 organization must provide a covered person and the covered person's health care 29 provider with access to a clear, convenient, and readily accessible process for 30 requesting an exception to application of the step therapy protocol.
