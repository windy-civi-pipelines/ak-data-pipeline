AS 21.07 is amended by adding new sections to read: 12 Article 2. Prior Authorizations. 13 Sec. 21.07.100. Prior authorization requests.

The process must be 17 reasonable and efficient and minimize administrative burdens on health care providers 18 and facilities. 19 (b) If a health care provider submits a prior authorization request that contains 20 the information necessary to make a determination, a health care insurer shall make a 21 determination and notify the provider of the decision within 22 (1) 72 hours after receiving a standard request submitted by a method 23 other than facsimile; 24 (2) 72 hours, excluding weekends, after receiving a standard request 25 submitted by facsimile; or 26 (3) 24 hours after receiving an expedited request. 27 (c) If a health care provider submits a prior authorization request that does not 28 contain the information necessary to make a determination, the health care insurer 29 shall request specific additional information from the covered person's health care 30 provider within 31 (1) one calendar day after receiving an expedited request; or 01 (2) three calendar days after receiving a standard request. 02 (d) If a health care insurer determines that the information provided by a 03 health care provider is not sufficient to make a determination under (b) of this section, 04 the health care insurer may request additional information.

The health care insurer must notify the health care provider and covered 08 person of the due date along with the request for additional information and specify 09 the additional information needed to complete the request. 10 (e) A health care insurer that receives a prior authorization request from a 11 health care provider shall provide to the health care provider confirmation of receipt 12 that shows the date and time the request was received by the health care insurer. 13 (f) A prior authorization request submitted under this section is considered 14 approved if the health care insurer fails to provide a written denial, approval, or 15 request for additional information within the time specified under this section. 16 Sec. 21.07.110. Prior authorization standards. (a) A health care insurer shall 17 make its most current prior authorization standards available to a covered person and 18 health care provider on the health care insurer's Internet website, including 19 information or documentation to be submitted by the covered person or health care 20 provider or facility.

Period of validity of prior authorization. (a) A prior 24 authorization for a chronic condition is valid for a period of not less than 12 months 25 while the covered person remains covered by the health care policy. If the treatment 26 plan for a chronic condition is unchanged and the covered person's health care 27 provider submits to the health care insurer certification of compliance with the current 28 treatment plan, the health care insurer shall automatically renew the prior 29 authorization approval for the chronic condition for an additional 12-month period. 30 (b) Except for a prior authorization for a chronic condition subject to (a) of 31 this section, a prior authorization is valid for a period of 90 calendar days or a duration 01 that is clinically appropriate, whichever is longer.

The application programming interface must be consistent with 01 the technical standards and implementation dates established in the Centers for 02 Medicare and Medicaid Services rules on interoperability and patient access. The 03 application programming interface must support the exchange of prior authorization 04 requests and determinations for medical care and prescription drugs, including 05 information on covered alternative prescription drugs. The application programming 06 interface must indicate that a prior authorization denial, an authorization of medical 07 care less intensive than the medical care included in the original request, or an 08 authorization of a prescription drug other than the one included in the original prior 09 authorization request is an adverse benefit determination and is subject to the health 10 care insurer's grievance and appeal process under AS 21.07.005. 11 Sec. 21.07.160. Step therapy restrictions and exceptions. (a) A health care 12 insurer that provides coverage under a health care insurance policy for the treatment of 13 Stage 4 advanced metastatic cancer may not limit or exclude coverage under the health 14 benefit plan for a drug that is approved by the United States Food and Drug 15 Administration and that is on the insurer's prescription drug formulary by mandating 16 that a covered person with Stage 4 advanced metastatic cancer undergo step therapy if 17 the use of the approved drug is an approved indication by the United States Food and 18 Drug Administration or on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Drugs and 19 Biologics Compendium as an indication for the treatment of Stage 4 advanced 20 metastatic cancer consistent with Category 1 or Category 2A of evidence and 21 consensus or peer-reviewed medical literature. 22 (b) If coverage of a prescription drug for the treatment of any medical 23 condition is restricted by a health care insurer or utilization review organization 24 because of a step therapy protocol, the health care insurer or utilization review 25 organization must provide a covered person and the covered person's health care 26 provider with access to a clear, convenient, and readily accessible process for 27 requesting an exception to application of the step therapy protocol. A health care 28 insurer or utilization review organization may use its existing medical exceptions 29 process to satisfy this requirement. The health care insurer or utilization review 30 organization shall disclose the process to the covered person and the covered person's 31 health care provider, along with the information needed to process the request, and 01 make the process available on the health care insurer's Internet website for the plan. 02 (c) A health care insurer or utilization review organization shall grant a step 03 therapy exception under this section if the covered person has tried the prescription 04 drugs required under the step therapy protocol while under a current or previous health 05 care insurance policy or health benefit plan, including a health care insurance policy or 06 health benefit plan offered by a different insurer or payor, and the prescription drugs 07 were discontinued because of lack of efficacy or effectiveness, diminished effect, or 08 an adverse event or if the covered person's health care provider attests that coverage of 09 the prescribed prescription drug is necessary to save the life of the covered person. 10 Use of drug samples from a pharmacy may not be considered trial and failure of a 11 preferred prescription drug required under a step therapy protocol. 12 (d) The health care insurer or utilization review organization may request 13 relevant information from the covered person or the covered person's health care 14 provider to support a step therapy exception request made under this section. Upon 15 granting a step therapy exception request, the health care insurer or utilization review 16 organization shall authorize dispensation of and coverage for the prescription drug 17 prescribed by the covered person's health care provider if the drug is a covered drug 18 under the health care insurance policy. 19 (e) This section may not be construed to prevent a 20 (1) health care insurer or utilization review organization from requiring 21 a covered person to try a generic equivalent or other brand name drug before 22 providing coverage for the requested prescription drug; or 23 (2) health care provider from prescribing a prescription drug that the 24 provider determines is medically appropriate. 25 Sec. 21.07.170.
