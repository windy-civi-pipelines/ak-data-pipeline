AS 15.05.020 is amended to read: 10 Sec. 15.05.020. Rules for determining residence of voter. For the purpose of 11 determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following 12 rules: 13 (1) A person may not be considered to have gained a residence solely 01 by reason of presence nor may a person lose it solely by reason of absence while in the 02 civil or military service of this state or of the United States or of absence because of 03 marriage to a person engaged in the civil or military service of this state or the United 04 States, while a student at an institution of learning, while in an institution or asylum at 05 public expense, while confined in public prison, while engaged in the navigation of 06 waters of this state or the United States or of the high seas, while residing on [UPON] 07 an Indian or military reservation, or while residing in the Alaska Pioneers' Home or 08 the Alaska Veterans' Home. 09 (2) The residence of a person is that place in which the person's 10 physical habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever absent, the person has an 11 articulable and reasonable plan [THE INTENTION] to return. If a person resides in 12 one place, but does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence. 13 Temporary work sites do not constitute a dwelling place. 14 (3) [A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE IS MADE ONLY BY THE ACT 15 OF REMOVAL JOINED WITH THE INTENT TO REMAIN IN ANOTHER 16 PLACE.] There can only be one residence. 17 (4) A person does not lose residence if the person leaves home and 18 goes to another country, state, or place in this state for temporary purposes only and 19 with the intent of returning to the person's physical habitation. 20 (5) A person does not gain residence in any place to which the person 21 comes without the present intention to establish a physical habitation 22 [PERMANENT DWELLING] at that place indefinitely. 23 (6) A person loses residence in this state if the person establishes 24 residence in another state or votes in another state's election, either in person or by 25 absentee ballot, and will not be eligible to vote in this state until again qualifying 26 under AS 15.05.010. 27 (7) The term of residence is computed by including the day on which 28 the person's residence begins and excluding the day of election. 29 (8) The address of a voter as it appears on the official voter registration 30 record is presumptive evidence of the person's voting residence. This presumption is 31 negated [ONLY] if the voter notifies the director in writing of a change of voting 01 residence. When a voter's qualification is questioned under AS 15.15.210 or 02 challenged in accordance with the procedure adopted in regulation under 03 AS 15.20.215, the presumption may be rebutted by providing evidence to the 04 division that the voter has established residence in another state or place in this 05 state or evidence that the voter is not a resident under (2) - (7) of this section. 06 (9) Notwithstanding (2) of this section, a person who changes the 07 place in which the person's physical habitation is fixed may continue to vote in 08 the senate district or judicial district that includes the person's former place of 09 physical habitation as provided in AS 15.20.015 if the person has an articulable 10 and reasonable plan to remain in or return to that senate district or judicial 11 district. 12 * Sec. 2.

AS 15.05.020 is amended to read: 10 Sec. 15.05.020. Rules for determining residence of voter. For the purpose of 11 determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following 12 rules: 13 (1) A person may not be considered to have gained a residence solely 01 by reason of presence nor may a person lose it solely by reason of absence while in the 02 civil or military service of this state or of the United States or of absence because of 03 marriage to a person engaged in the civil or military service of this state or the United 04 States, while a student at an institution of learning, while in an institution or asylum at 05 public expense, while confined in public prison, while engaged in the navigation of 06 waters of this state or the United States or of the high seas, while residing on [UPON] 07 an Indian or military reservation, or while residing in the Alaska Pioneers' Home or 08 the Alaska Veterans' Home. 09 (2) The residence of a person is that place in which the person's 10 physical habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever absent, the person has an 11 articulable and reasonable plan [THE INTENTION] to return. If a person resides in 12 one place, but does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence. 13 Temporary work sites do not constitute a dwelling place. 14 (3) [A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE IS MADE ONLY BY THE ACT 15 OF REMOVAL JOINED WITH THE INTENT TO REMAIN IN ANOTHER 16 PLACE.] There can only be one residence. 17 (4) A person does not lose residence if the person leaves home and 18 goes to another country, state, or place in this state for temporary purposes only and 19 with the intent of returning to the person's physical habitation. 20 (5) A person does not gain residence in any place to which the person 21 comes without the present intention to establish a physical habitation 22 [PERMANENT DWELLING] at that place indefinitely. 23 (6) A person loses residence in this state if the person establishes 24 residence in another state or votes in another state's election, either in person or by 25 absentee ballot, and will not be eligible to vote in this state until again qualifying 26 under AS 15.05.010. 27 (7) The term of residence is computed by including the day on which 28 the person's residence begins and excluding the day of election. 29 (8) The address of a voter as it appears on the official voter registration 30 record is presumptive evidence of the person's voting residence. This presumption is 31 negated [ONLY] if the voter notifies the director in writing of a change of voting 01 residence. When a voter's qualification is questioned under AS 15.15.210 or 02 challenged in accordance with the procedure adopted in regulation under 03 AS 15.20.215, the presumption may be rebutted by providing evidence to the 04 division that the voter has established residence in another state or place in this 05 state or evidence that the voter is not a resident under (2) - (7) of this section. 06 (9) Notwithstanding (2) of this section, a person who changes the 07 place in which the person's physical habitation is fixed may continue to vote in 08 the senate district or judicial district that includes the person's former place of 09 physical habitation as provided in AS 15.20.015 if the person has an articulable 10 and reasonable plan to remain in or return to that senate district or judicial 11 district. 12 * Sec. 2.
