AS 15.05.010 is amended to read: 09 Sec. 15.05.010. Voter qualification. A person may vote at any election who 10 (1) is a citizen of the United States; 11 (2) is 18 years of age or older; 12 (3) has been a resident of the state and of the house district in which 13 the person seeks to vote for at least 30 days just before the election; and 01 (4) has registered [BEFORE THE ELECTION] as required under 02 AS 15.07 and is not registered to vote in another jurisdiction. 03 * Sec. 2. AS 15.05.020 is amended to read: 04 Sec. 15.05.020. Rules for determining residence of voter. For the purpose of 05 determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following 06 rules: 07 (1) A person may not be considered to have gained a residence solely 08 by reason of presence nor may a person lose it solely by reason of absence while in the 09 civil or military service of this state or of the United States or of absence because of 10 marriage to a person engaged in the civil or military service of this state or the United 11 States, while a student at an institution of learning, while in an institution or asylum at 12 public expense, while confined in public prison, while engaged in the navigation of 13 waters of this state or the United States or of the high seas, while residing on [UPON] 14 an Indian or military reservation, or while residing in the Alaska Pioneers' Home or 15 the Alaska Veterans' Home. 16 (2) The residence of a person is that place in which the person's 17 physical habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever absent, the person has an 18 articulable and reasonable plan [THE INTENTION] to return. If a person resides in 19 one place, but does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence. 20 Temporary work sites do not constitute a dwelling place. 21 (3) [A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE IS MADE ONLY BY THE ACT 22 OF REMOVAL JOINED WITH THE INTENT TO REMAIN IN ANOTHER 23 PLACE.] There can only be one residence. 24 (4) A person does not lose residence if the person leaves home and 25 goes to another country, state, or place in this state for temporary purposes only and 26 with the intent of returning to the person's residence. 27 (5) A person does not gain residence in any place to which the person 28 comes without the present intention to establish a permanent dwelling at that place. 29 (6) A person loses residence in this state if the person establishes 30 residence in another state or votes in another state's election, either in person or by 31 absentee ballot, and will not be eligible to vote in this state until again qualifying 01 under AS 15.05.010. 02 (7) The term of residence is computed by including the day on which 03 the person's residence begins and excluding the day of election. 04 (8) The address of a voter as it appears on the official voter registration 05 record is presumptive evidence of the person's voting residence. This presumption is 06 negated [ONLY] if the voter notifies the director in writing of a change of voting 07 residence. When a voter's qualification is questioned under AS 15.15.210 or 08 challenged in accordance with the procedure adopted in regulation under 09 AS 15.20.215, the presumption may be rebutted by providing evidence to the 10 division that the voter has established residence in another state or place in this 11 state or evidence that the voter is not a resident under (2) - (7) of this section. 12 * Sec. 3. AS 15.07.040 is amended by adding new subsections to read: 13 (b) A person who is at least 16 years of age and under 18 years of age may 14 preregister to vote.

AS 15.05.010 is amended to read: 09 Sec. 15.05.010. Voter qualification. A person may vote at any election who 10 (1) is a citizen of the United States; 11 (2) is 18 years of age or older; 12 (3) has been a resident of the state and of the house district in which 13 the person seeks to vote for at least 30 days just before the election; and 01 (4) has registered [BEFORE THE ELECTION] as required under 02 AS 15.07 and is not registered to vote in another jurisdiction. 03 * Sec. 2. AS 15.05.020 is amended to read: 04 Sec. 15.05.020. Rules for determining residence of voter. For the purpose of 05 determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following 06 rules: 07 (1) A person may not be considered to have gained a residence solely 08 by reason of presence nor may a person lose it solely by reason of absence while in the 09 civil or military service of this state or of the United States or of absence because of 10 marriage to a person engaged in the civil or military service of this state or the United 11 States, while a student at an institution of learning, while in an institution or asylum at 12 public expense, while confined in public prison, while engaged in the navigation of 13 waters of this state or the United States or of the high seas, while residing on [UPON] 14 an Indian or military reservation, or while residing in the Alaska Pioneers' Home or 15 the Alaska Veterans' Home. 16 (2) The residence of a person is that place in which the person's 17 physical habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever absent, the person has an 18 articulable and reasonable plan [THE INTENTION] to return. If a person resides in 19 one place, but does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence. 20 Temporary work sites do not constitute a dwelling place. 21 (3) [A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE IS MADE ONLY BY THE ACT 22 OF REMOVAL JOINED WITH THE INTENT TO REMAIN IN ANOTHER 23 PLACE.] There can only be one residence. 24 (4) A person does not lose residence if the person leaves home and 25 goes to another country, state, or place in this state for temporary purposes only and 26 with the intent of returning to the person's residence. 27 (5) A person does not gain residence in any place to which the person 28 comes without the present intention to establish a permanent dwelling at that place. 29 (6) A person loses residence in this state if the person establishes 30 residence in another state or votes in another state's election, either in person or by 31 absentee ballot, and will not be eligible to vote in this state until again qualifying 01 under AS 15.05.010. 02 (7) The term of residence is computed by including the day on which 03 the person's residence begins and excluding the day of election. 04 (8) The address of a voter as it appears on the official voter registration 05 record is presumptive evidence of the person's voting residence. This presumption is 06 negated [ONLY] if the voter notifies the director in writing of a change of voting 07 residence. When a voter's qualification is questioned under AS 15.15.210 or 08 challenged in accordance with the procedure adopted in regulation under 09 AS 15.20.215, the presumption may be rebutted by providing evidence to the 10 division that the voter has established residence in another state or place in this 11 state or evidence that the voter is not a resident under (2) - (7) of this section. 12 * Sec. 3.
