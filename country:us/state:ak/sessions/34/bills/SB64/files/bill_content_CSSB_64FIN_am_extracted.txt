AS 15.05.020 is amended to read: 11 Sec. 15.05.020. Rules for determining residence of voter. For the purpose of 12 determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following 01 rules: 02 (1) A person may not be considered to have gained a residence solely 03 by reason of presence nor may a person lose it solely by reason of absence while in the 04 civil or military service of this state or of the United States or of absence because of 05 marriage to a person engaged in the civil or military service of this state or the United 06 States, while a student at an institution of learning, while in an institution or asylum at 07 public expense, while confined in public prison, while engaged in the navigation of 08 waters of this state or the United States or of the high seas, while residing on [UPON] 09 an Indian or military reservation, or while residing in the Alaska Pioneers' Home or 10 the Alaska Veterans' Home. 11 (2) The residence of a person is that place in which the person's 12 physical habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever absent, the person has an 13 articulable and reasonable plan [THE INTENTION] to return. If a person resides in 14 one place, but does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence. 15 Temporary work sites do not constitute a dwelling place. 16 (3) [A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE IS MADE ONLY BY THE ACT 17 OF REMOVAL JOINED WITH THE INTENT TO REMAIN IN ANOTHER 18 PLACE.] There can only be one residence. 19 (4) A person does not lose residence if the person leaves home and 20 goes to another country, state, or place in this state for temporary purposes only and 21 with the intent of returning to the person's physical habitation. 22 (5) A person does not gain residence in any place to which the person 23 comes without the present intention to establish a physical habitation 24 [PERMANENT DWELLING] at that place indefinitely. 25 (6) A person loses residence in this state if the person establishes 26 residence in another state or votes in another state's election, either in person or by 27 absentee ballot, and will not be eligible to vote in this state until again qualifying 28 under AS 15.05.010. 29 (7) The term of residence is computed by including the day on which 30 the person's residence begins and excluding the day of election. 31 (8) The address of a voter as it appears on the official voter registration 01 record is presumptive evidence of the person's voting residence. This presumption is 02 negated [ONLY] if the voter notifies the director in writing of a change of voting 03 residence. When a voter's qualification is questioned under AS 15.15.210 or 04 challenged in accordance with the procedure adopted in regulation under 05 AS 15.20.215, the presumption may be rebutted by providing evidence to the 06 division that the voter has established residence in another country, state, or 07 place in this state or evidence that the voter is not a resident under (2) - (7) of this 08 section. 09 * Sec. 2. AS 15.07.060(c) is amended to read: 10 (c) Each applicant who requests registration in person before a registration 11 official shall exhibit one form of identification to the official, including a driver's 12 license, state identification card, current and valid photo identification, birth 13 certificate, passport, or identification card issued by a federally recognized tribe 14 [HUNTING OR FISHING LICENSE].

If the applicant cannot comply with the 22 requirement of (a)(2) of this section because the applicant has not been issued any of 23 the listed numbers, the applicant may instead submit a copy of one of the following 24 forms of identification: a driver's license, state identification card, current and valid 25 photo identification, birth certificate, passport, or identification card issued by a 26 federally recognized tribe [HUNTING OR FISHING LICENSE]. 27 * Sec. 4.

AS 15.05.020 is amended to read: 11 Sec. 15.05.020. Rules for determining residence of voter. For the purpose of 12 determining residence for voting, the place of residence is governed by the following 01 rules: 02 (1) A person may not be considered to have gained a residence solely 03 by reason of presence nor may a person lose it solely by reason of absence while in the 04 civil or military service of this state or of the United States or of absence because of 05 marriage to a person engaged in the civil or military service of this state or the United 06 States, while a student at an institution of learning, while in an institution or asylum at 07 public expense, while confined in public prison, while engaged in the navigation of 08 waters of this state or the United States or of the high seas, while residing on [UPON] 09 an Indian or military reservation, or while residing in the Alaska Pioneers' Home or 10 the Alaska Veterans' Home. 11 (2) The residence of a person is that place in which the person's 12 physical habitation is fixed, and to which, whenever absent, the person has an 13 articulable and reasonable plan [THE INTENTION] to return. If a person resides in 14 one place, but does business in another, the former is the person's place of residence. 15 Temporary work sites do not constitute a dwelling place. 16 (3) [A CHANGE OF RESIDENCE IS MADE ONLY BY THE ACT 17 OF REMOVAL JOINED WITH THE INTENT TO REMAIN IN ANOTHER 18 PLACE.] There can only be one residence. 19 (4) A person does not lose residence if the person leaves home and 20 goes to another country, state, or place in this state for temporary purposes only and 21 with the intent of returning to the person's physical habitation. 22 (5) A person does not gain residence in any place to which the person 23 comes without the present intention to establish a physical habitation 24 [PERMANENT DWELLING] at that place indefinitely. 25 (6) A person loses residence in this state if the person establishes 26 residence in another state or votes in another state's election, either in person or by 27 absentee ballot, and will not be eligible to vote in this state until again qualifying 28 under AS 15.05.010. 29 (7) The term of residence is computed by including the day on which 30 the person's residence begins and excluding the day of election. 31 (8) The address of a voter as it appears on the official voter registration 01 record is presumptive evidence of the person's voting residence. This presumption is 02 negated [ONLY] if the voter notifies the director in writing of a change of voting 03 residence. When a voter's qualification is questioned under AS 15.15.210 or 04 challenged in accordance with the procedure adopted in regulation under 05 AS 15.20.215, the presumption may be rebutted by providing evidence to the 06 division that the voter has established residence in another country, state, or 07 place in this state or evidence that the voter is not a resident under (2) - (7) of this 08 section. 09 * Sec. 2.

If the applicant cannot comply with the 22 requirement of (a)(2) of this section because the applicant has not been issued any of 23 the listed numbers, the applicant may instead submit a copy of one of the following 24 forms of identification: a driver's license, state identification card, current and valid 25 photo identification, birth certificate, passport, or identification card issued by a 26 federally recognized tribe [HUNTING OR FISHING LICENSE]. 27 * Sec. 4.

The division may not disclose personally identifiable information 31 obtained from the Department of Revenue. 01 (o) The division, in cooperation with the Department of Revenue, shall submit 02 an annual report to the governor and to the senate secretary and chief clerk of the 03 house of representatives on or before the first day of each regular session of the 04 legislature and notify the legislature that the report is available.
