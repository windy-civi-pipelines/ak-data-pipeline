The uncodified law of the State of Alaska is amended by adding a new section 06 to read: 07 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. The activities authorized by 08 AS 46.06.200 - 46.06.290, added by sec. 9 of this Act, require collaboration among 09 manufacturers, electronics producer responsibility organizations, and other entities that 10 perform activities directly related to manufacturer e-scrap programs. These activities will 11 enable collection, recycling, and disposal of covered electronic devices in a safe and effective 12 manner, which is in the best interest of the public. The benefits of collaboration, together with 13 the active state supervision provided by the Department of Environmental Conservation under 14 AS 46.06.200 - 46.06.290, outweigh potential adverse effects. Therefore, the legislature 01 intends to provide immunity through the state action doctrine from federal antitrust laws for 02 participating in manufacturer e-scrap programs as required by AS 46.06.200 - 46.06.290. 03 * Sec. 2. AS 45.50.572(b) is amended to read: 04 (b) AS 45.50.562 - 45.50.596 do not forbid actions or arrangements authorized 05 or regulated under the laws of the United States that exempt these actions or 06 arrangements from application of the antitrust laws of the United States or under the 07 following statutes of this state: 08 (1) AS 06.05.235 and 06.05.570; 09 (2) AS 10.15; [AND] 10 (3) AS 31.05.110; and 11 (4) AS 46.06.200 - 46.06.290. 12 * Sec. 3.
