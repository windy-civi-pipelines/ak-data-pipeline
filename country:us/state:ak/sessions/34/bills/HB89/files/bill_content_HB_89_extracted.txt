The provisions of a 25 protective order issued under this section are effective for six months unless earlier 26 dissolved by the court. 27 (c) A protective order issued under this section shall prohibit the respondent 28 from possessing, owning, purchasing, receiving, or attempting to purchase or receive a 29 firearm or ammunition. 30 (d) If the court issues a protective order under this section, the court shall 31 (1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by 01 the petitioner and by the respondent, if present; 02 (2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement 03 agency for expedited service; 04 (3) direct the respondent to surrender to the appropriate law 05 enforcement agency or sell to a firearms dealer all firearms and ammunition that the 06 respondent possesses or owns within 24 hours after receiving the order. 07 Sec. 18.65.820.

If the court finds that the petition establishes by a 11 preponderance of the evidence that the respondent poses a significant danger of injury 12 to self or others by possessing, owning, purchasing, or receiving a firearm, that less 13 restrictive alternatives have been tried and were ineffective, and that a peace officer 14 has certified to the court in writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide 15 notice to the respondent, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent 16 issue a protective order. Before issuing the protective order, the court shall examine on 17 oath the petitioner and any witnesses the petitioner produces. The court may require 18 the petitioner and any witnesses to submit a written affidavit signed under oath instead 19 of examining the petitioner and witnesses. An ex parte protective order issued under 20 this subsection shall prohibit the respondent from possessing, owning, purchasing, or 21 receiving a firearm or ammunition. An ex parte protective order expires 20 days after 22 the order is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of either the 23 petitioner or the respondent after notice and, if requested, a hearing. If the court issues 24 an ex parte protective order, the court shall have the order delivered to the appropriate 25 law enforcement agency for expedited service. 26 (b) A peace officer may request an emergency gun violence protective order 27 from a judicial officer.

If the court finds by a 29 preponderance of the evidence that the respondent poses an immediate danger of 30 injury to self or others by possessing, owning, purchasing, or receiving a firearm and 31 that less restrictive alternatives have been tried and were ineffective, the court ex parte 01 shall issue an emergency protective order. An emergency protective order shall 02 prohibit the respondent from possessing, owning, purchasing, or receiving a firearm or 03 ammunition. An emergency protective order expires 72 hours after it is issued unless 04 dissolved earlier by the court at the request of the petitioner. A peace officer who 05 obtains an emergency protective order under this subsection shall 06 (1) place the provisions of an oral order in writing on a form provided 07 by the court and file the written order with the issuing court by the end of the judicial 08 day after the order is issued; and 09 (2) immediately serve a copy of the order on the respondent. 10 (c) In determining whether to issue a protective order under this section, the 11 court may consider evidence that includes 12 (1) a recent act or threat of violence by the respondent against self or 13 others, regardless of whether the act or threat involved a firearm; 14 (2) a pattern of acts or threats of violence by the respondent against 15 self or others within the previous 12 months; 16 (3) behavior by the respondent that presents an imminent threat of 17 harm to self or others; 18 (4) a violation of a protective order by the respondent; 19 (5) a previous or existing protective order against the respondent; 20 (6) the respondent's prior conviction of a crime that constitutes 21 domestic violence as defined in AS 18.66.990; 22 (7) the respondent's ownership of, access to, or intent to possess a 23 firearm; 24 (8) the unlawful or reckless use, display, or brandishing of a firearm by 25 the respondent; 26 (9) a history of use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force 27 by the respondent against another person; 28 (10) the respondent's history of stalking another person; 29 (11) the prior arrest of the respondent for a felony offense or violent 30 crime; 31 (12) corroborated evidence of the respondent's abuse of controlled 01 substances or alcohol; 02 (13) the respondent's recent acquisition of a firearm or ammunition. 03 Sec. 18.65.825. Modification of gun violence protective order. (a) A 04 petitioner or the respondent may request modification of a gun violence protective 05 order issued under AS 18.65.815 or 18.65.820(a). If a request is made for modification 06 of 07 (1) a protective order, after notice and hearing under AS 18.65.815, the 08 court shall schedule a hearing within 20 days after the date the request is made, except 09 that, if the court finds that the request is meritless on its face, the court may deny the 10 request without a hearing; or 11 (2) an ex parte protective order under AS 18.65.820(a), the court shall 12 schedule a hearing on three days' notice or on shorter notice as the court may 13 prescribe. 14 (b) If the court modifies a protective order under this section, the court shall 15 issue a modified order and shall 16 (1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by 17 the respondent, if present at the hearing; and 18 (2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement 19 agency for expedited service. 20 Sec. 18.65.830.

When the protective order expires, the law 05 enforcement agency shall return the firearms or ammunition to the respondent. 06 (d) A respondent who has surrendered firearms or ammunition to a law 07 enforcement agency and does not want the firearms or ammunition returned may sell 08 or transfer title of the firearms or ammunition to a firearms dealer. 09 (e) A person other than the respondent who claims title to any firearms or 10 ammunition surrendered under a protective order issued under AS 18.65.815 - 11 18.65.825 may petition the court to have the firearms or ammunition returned to the 12 person. 13 Sec. 18.65.835.
