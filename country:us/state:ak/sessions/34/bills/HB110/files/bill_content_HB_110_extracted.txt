DATA SYSTEM. 29 (A) The Commission shall provide for the development, maintenance, 30 operation, and utilization of a coordinated Data System. 31 (B) The Commission shall assign each applicant for a Multistate 01 License a unique identifier, as determined by the Rules of the Commission. 02 (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of State law to the contrary, a 03 Member State shall submit a uniform data set to the Data System on all individuals to 04 whom this Compact is applicable as required by the Rules of the Commission, 05 including: 06 (1) Identifying information; 07 (2) Licensure data; 08 (3) Adverse Actions against a license and information related 09 thereto; 10 (4) Non-confidential information related to Alternative 11 Program participation, the beginning and ending dates of such participation, 12 and other information related to such participation not made confidential under 13 Member State law; 14 (5) Any denial of application for licensure, and the reason(s) 15 for such denial; 16 (6) The presence of Current Significant Investigative 17 Information; and 18 (7) Other information that may facilitate the administration of 19 this Compact or the protection of the public, as determined by the Rules of the 20 Commission. 21 (D) The records and information provided to a Member State pursuant 22 to this Compact or through the Data System, when certified by the Commission or an 23 agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business records of the Commission, 24 and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, 25 quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings in a Member State. 26 (E) Current Significant Investigative Information pertaining to a 27 Licensee in any Member State will only be available to other Member States. 28 (1) It is the responsibility of the Member States to report any 29 Adverse Action against a Licensee and to monitor the database to determine 30 whether Adverse Action has been taken against a Licensee.

RULEMAKING. 09 (A) The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to 10 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of 11 the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of 12 competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because the Commission 13 exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes 14 of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable 15 standard of review. 16 (B) The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each 17 Member State, provided however that, where the Rules of the Commission conflict 18 with the laws of the Member State that establish the Member State's laws, regulations, 19 and applicable standards that govern the practice of Social Work as held by a court of 20 competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that State 21 to the extent of the conflict. 22 (C) The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to 23 the criteria set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall 24 become binding on the day following adoption or the date specified in the rule or 25 amendment, whichever is later. 26 (D) If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule 27 or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used 28 to adopt the Compact within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then 29 such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member State. 30 (E) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the 31 Commission. 01 (F) Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a 02 public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, 03 opinions, and arguments. 04 (G) Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at 05 least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will hold a 06 public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide a Notice of 07 Proposed Rulemaking: 08 (1) On the website of the Commission or other publicly 09 accessible platform; 10 (2) To persons who have requested notice of the Commission's 11 notices of proposed rulemaking; and 12 (3) In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule 13 specify. 14 (H) The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include: 15 (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which 16 the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if 17 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the Commission 18 will consider and vote on the proposed Rule; 19 (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video 20 conference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall include the 21 mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; 22 (3) The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor; 23 (4) A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any 24 interested person; and 25 (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit written 26 comments. 27 (I) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all 28 written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to the 29 proposed Rule shall be available to the public. 30 (J) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate 31 hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission 01 at hearings required by this section. 02 (K) The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final 03 action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking record and the full text of the 04 Rule. 05 (1) The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule 06 provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule. 07 (2) The Commission shall provide an explanation of the 08 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons 09 for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. 10 (3) The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date 11 for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Section 12(L), the 12 effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the 13 notice that it adopted or amended the Rule. 14 (L) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission 15 may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 48 hours' notice, with opportunity to 16 comment, provided that the usual Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact 17 and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably 18 possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For 19 the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted 20 immediately in order to: 21 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; 22 (2) Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds; 23 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is 24 established by federal law or rule; or 25 (4) Protect public health and safety. 26 (M) The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission 27 may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting 28 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. 29 Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The 30 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days 31 after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results 01 in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to 02 the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the 03 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the 04 revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission. 05 (N) No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this 06 Compact. 07 SECTION 13. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT. 08 (A) Oversight 09 (1) The executive and judicial branches of State government in 10 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary 11 and appropriate to implement the Compact. 12 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is 13 proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought 14 solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal 15 office of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and 16 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in 17 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit 18 the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for 19 professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter. 20 (3) The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of 21 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the 22 Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 23 purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a 24 judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated 25 Rules. 26 (B) Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination 27 (1) If the Commission determines that a Member State has 28 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this 29 Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written 30 notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the default, 31 the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the 01 Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance 02 regarding the default. 03 (2) The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of 04 default to the other Member States. 05 (C) If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State 06 may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the 07 delegates of the Member States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on 08 that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A 09 cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities 10 incurred during the period of default. 11 (D) Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only 12 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to 13 suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority 14 and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's State 15 Licensing Authority and each of the Member States' State Licensing Authority. 16 (E) A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, 17 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including 18 obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. 19 (F) Upon the termination of a State's membership from this Compact, 20 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of such 21 termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted 22 pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the date of said notice 23 of termination. 24 (G) The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is 25 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed 26 upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State. 27 (H) The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by 28 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district 29 where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded 30 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 31 (I) Dispute Resolution 01 (1) Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall 02 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member 03 States and between Member and non-Member States. 04 (2) The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for 05 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. 06 (J) Enforcement 07 (1) By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission may 08 initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the United States 09 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 10 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions 11 of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both 12 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 13 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 14 reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 15 remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies 16 available under federal or the defaulting Member State's law. 17 (2) A Member State may initiate legal action against the 18 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the 19 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce 20 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The 21 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 22 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all 23 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 24 (3) No person other than a Member State shall enforce this 25 Compact against the Commission. 26 SECTION 14. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT. 27 (A) The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the 28 Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State. 29 (1) On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 30 Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven 31 Member States ("Charter Member States") to determine if the statute enacted 01 by each such Charter Member State is materially different than the model 02 Compact statute. 03 (a) A Charter Member State whose enactment is found 04 to be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be 05 entitled to the default process set forth in Section 13. 06 (b) If any Member State is later found to be in default, 07 or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall 08 remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the 09 number of Member States should be less than seven. 10 (2) Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the 11 seven initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in 12 Section 10(C)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different 13 from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in 14 the Compact. 15 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in 16 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the 17 effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall 18 be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated 19 by the Commission. 20 (4) Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the 21 Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the 22 Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law 23 in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission 24 shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law 25 in that State. 26 (B) Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a 27 statute repealing the same. 28 (1) A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 29 days after enactment of the repealing statute. 30 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of 31 the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative 01 and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the 02 effective date of withdrawal. 03 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this 04 Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all 05 Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory 06 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize 07 all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 180 days after 08 the date of such notice of withdrawal. 09 (C) Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate 10 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a 11 Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of 12 this Compact. 13 (D) This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No 14 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member 15 State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States. 16 SECTION 15. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY. 17 (A) This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be 18 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and 19 administration of the Compact.

All Home 07 State disciplinary orders that impose Adverse Action against the license of a 08 Regulated Social Worker shall include a statement that the Regulated Social Worker's 09 Multistate Authorization to Practice is deactivated in all Member States until all 10 conditions of the decision, order or agreement are satisfied. 11 (H) If a Member State takes Adverse Action, it shall promptly notify 12 the administrator of the Data System. The administrator of the Data System shall 13 promptly notify the Home State and all other Member States of any Adverse Actions 14 by Remote States. 15 (I) Nothing in this Compact shall override a Member State's decision 16 that participation in an Alternative Program may be used in lieu of Adverse Action. 17 (J) Nothing in this Compact shall authorize a Member State to demand 18 the issuance of subpoenas for attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production 19 of evidence from another Member State for lawful actions within that Member State. 20 (K) Nothing in this Compact shall authorize a Member State to impose 21 discipline against a Regulated Social Worker who holds a Multistate Authorization to 22 Practice for lawful actions within another Member State. 23 SECTION 10.

DATA SYSTEM. 29 (A) The Commission shall provide for the development, maintenance, 30 operation, and utilization of a coordinated Data System. 31 (B) The Commission shall assign each applicant for a Multistate 01 License a unique identifier, as determined by the Rules of the Commission. 02 (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of State law to the contrary, a 03 Member State shall submit a uniform data set to the Data System on all individuals to 04 whom this Compact is applicable as required by the Rules of the Commission, 05 including: 06 (1) Identifying information; 07 (2) Licensure data; 08 (3) Adverse Actions against a license and information related 09 thereto; 10 (4) Non-confidential information related to Alternative 11 Program participation, the beginning and ending dates of such participation, 12 and other information related to such participation not made confidential under 13 Member State law; 14 (5) Any denial of application for licensure, and the reason(s) 15 for such denial; 16 (6) The presence of Current Significant Investigative 17 Information; and 18 (7) Other information that may facilitate the administration of 19 this Compact or the protection of the public, as determined by the Rules of the 20 Commission. 21 (D) The records and information provided to a Member State pursuant 22 to this Compact or through the Data System, when certified by the Commission or an 23 agent thereof, shall constitute the authenticated business records of the Commission, 24 and shall be entitled to any associated hearsay exception in any relevant judicial, 25 quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings in a Member State. 26 (E) Current Significant Investigative Information pertaining to a 27 Licensee in any Member State will only be available to other Member States. 28 (1) It is the responsibility of the Member States to report any 29 Adverse Action against a Licensee and to monitor the database to determine 30 whether Adverse Action has been taken against a Licensee.

RULEMAKING. 09 (A) The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in order to 10 effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of 11 the Compact. A Rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of 12 competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because the Commission 13 exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes 14 of the Compact, or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable 15 standard of review. 16 (B) The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law in each 17 Member State, provided however that, where the Rules of the Commission conflict 18 with the laws of the Member State that establish the Member State's laws, regulations, 19 and applicable standards that govern the practice of Social Work as held by a court of 20 competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective in that State 21 to the extent of the conflict. 22 (C) The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers pursuant to 23 the criteria set forth in this Section and the Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall 24 become binding on the day following adoption or the date specified in the rule or 25 amendment, whichever is later. 26 (D) If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States rejects a Rule 27 or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used 28 to adopt the Compact within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then 29 such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member State. 30 (E) Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the 31 Commission. 01 (F) Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission shall hold a 02 public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, 03 opinions, and arguments. 04 (G) Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, and at 05 least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at which the Commission will hold a 06 public hearing on the proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide a Notice of 07 Proposed Rulemaking: 08 (1) On the website of the Commission or other publicly 09 accessible platform; 10 (2) To persons who have requested notice of the Commission's 11 notices of proposed rulemaking; and 12 (3) In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule 13 specify. 14 (H) The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include: 15 (1) The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which 16 the Commission will hear public comments on the proposed Rule and, if 17 different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the Commission 18 will consider and vote on the proposed Rule; 19 (2) If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video 20 conference, or other electronic means, the Commission shall include the 21 mechanism for access to the hearing in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking; 22 (3) The text of the proposed Rule and the reason therefor; 23 (4) A request for comments on the proposed Rule from any 24 interested person; and 25 (5) The manner in which interested persons may submit written 26 comments. 27 (I) All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording and all 28 written comments and documents received by the Commission in response to the 29 proposed Rule shall be available to the public. 30 (J) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate 31 hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the Commission 01 at hearings required by this section. 02 (K) The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final 03 action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking record and the full text of the 04 Rule. 05 (1) The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed Rule 06 provided the changes do not enlarge the original purpose of the proposed Rule. 07 (2) The Commission shall provide an explanation of the 08 reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule as well as reasons 09 for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. 10 (3) The Commission shall determine a reasonable effective date 11 for the Rule. Except for an emergency as provided in Section 12(L), the 12 effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the 13 notice that it adopted or amended the Rule. 14 (L) Upon determination that an emergency exists, the Commission 15 may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 48 hours' notice, with opportunity to 16 comment, provided that the usual Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact 17 and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably 18 possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For 19 the purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted 20 immediately in order to: 21 (1) Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; 22 (2) Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds; 23 (3) Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that is 24 established by federal law or rule; or 25 (4) Protect public health and safety. 26 (M) The Commission or an authorized committee of the Commission 27 may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule for purposes of correcting 28 typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. 29 Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the Commission. The 30 revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) days 31 after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results 01 in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to 02 the Commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the 03 revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the 04 revision may not take effect without the approval of the Commission. 05 (N) No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply under this 06 Compact. 07 SECTION 13. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT. 08 (A) Oversight 09 (1) The executive and judicial branches of State government in 10 each Member State shall enforce this Compact and take all actions necessary 11 and appropriate to implement the Compact. 12 (2) Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue is 13 proper and judicial proceedings by or against the Commission shall be brought 14 solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal 15 office of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive venue and 16 jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in 17 alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or limit 18 the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a Licensee for 19 professional malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter. 20 (3) The Commission shall be entitled to receive service of 21 process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the 22 Compact and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 23 purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of process shall render a 24 judgment or order void as to the Commission, this Compact, or promulgated 25 Rules. 26 (B) Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination 27 (1) If the Commission determines that a Member State has 28 defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this 29 Compact or the promulgated Rules, the Commission shall provide written 30 notice to the defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the default, 31 the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the 01 Commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance 02 regarding the default. 03 (2) The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice of 04 default to the other Member States. 05 (C) If a State in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting State 06 may be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the 07 delegates of the Member States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on 08 that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A 09 cure of the default does not relieve the offending State of obligations or liabilities 10 incurred during the period of default. 11 (D) Termination of membership in the Compact shall be imposed only 12 after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to 13 suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority 14 and minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the defaulting State's State 15 Licensing Authority and each of the Member States' State Licensing Authority. 16 (E) A State that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, 17 obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including 18 obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. 19 (F) Upon the termination of a State's membership from this Compact, 20 that State shall immediately provide notice to all Licensees within that State of such 21 termination. The terminated State shall continue to recognize all licenses granted 22 pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six (6) months after the date of said notice 23 of termination. 24 (G) The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a State that is 25 found to be in default or that has been terminated from the Compact, unless agreed 26 upon in writing between the Commission and the defaulting State. 27 (H) The defaulting State may appeal the action of the Commission by 28 petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district 29 where the Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded 30 all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 31 (I) Dispute Resolution 01 (1) Upon request by a Member State, the Commission shall 02 attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that arise among Member 03 States and between Member and non-Member States. 04 (2) The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing for 05 both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. 06 (J) Enforcement 07 (1) By majority vote as provided by Rule, the Commission may 08 initiate legal action against a Member State in default in the United States 09 District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 10 Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions 11 of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The relief sought may include both 12 injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 13 the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 14 reasonable attorney's fees. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 15 remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies 16 available under federal or the defaulting Member State's law. 17 (2) A Member State may initiate legal action against the 18 Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the 19 federal district where the Commission has its principal offices to enforce 20 compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The 21 relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event 22 judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all 23 costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 24 (3) No person other than a Member State shall enforce this 25 Compact against the Commission. 26 SECTION 14. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT. 27 (A) The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which the 28 Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member State. 29 (1) On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 30 Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the first seven 31 Member States ("Charter Member States") to determine if the statute enacted 01 by each such Charter Member State is materially different than the model 02 Compact statute. 03 (a) A Charter Member State whose enactment is found 04 to be materially different from the model Compact statute shall be 05 entitled to the default process set forth in Section 13. 06 (b) If any Member State is later found to be in default, 07 or is terminated or withdraws from the Compact, the Commission shall 08 remain in existence and the Compact shall remain in effect even if the 09 number of Member States should be less than seven. 10 (2) Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to the 11 seven initial Charter Member States shall be subject to the process set forth in 12 Section 10(C)(21) to determine if their enactments are materially different 13 from the model Compact statute and whether they qualify for participation in 14 the Compact. 15 (3) All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission or in 16 furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the Compact prior to the 17 effective date of the Compact or the Commission coming into existence shall 18 be considered to be actions of the Commission unless specifically repudiated 19 by the Commission. 20 (4) Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the 21 Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws shall be subject to the 22 Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law 23 in that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission 24 shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the Compact becomes law 25 in that State. 26 (B) Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a 27 statute repealing the same. 28 (1) A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 29 days after enactment of the repealing statute. 30 (2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of 31 the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority to comply with the investigative 01 and Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the 02 effective date of withdrawal. 03 (3) Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this 04 Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all 05 Licensees within that State. Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory 06 enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize 07 all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 180 days after 08 the date of such notice of withdrawal. 09 (C) Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to invalidate 10 or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a 11 Member State and a non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of 12 this Compact. 13 (D) This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No 14 amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding upon any Member 15 State until it is enacted into the laws of all Member States. 16 SECTION 15. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY. 17 (A) This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority shall be 18 liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, and the implementation and 19 administration of the Compact. Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or 20 requiring the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the Commission's 21 rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. 22 (B) The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and if any 23 phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact is held by a court of competent 24 jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking 25 participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any 26 government, agency, person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court 27 of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this Compact and the 28 applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person or circumstance shall 29 not be affected thereby. 30 (C) Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the Commission may 31 deny a State's participation in the Compact or, in accordance with the requirements of 01 Section 13(B), terminate a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it 02 determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State is a material departure 03 from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the 04 constitution of any Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as 05 to the remaining Member States and in full force and effect as to the Member State 06 affected as to all severable matters. 07 SECTION 16. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE LAWS. 08 (A) A Licensee providing services in a Remote State under a 09 Multistate Authorization to Practice shall adhere to the laws and regulations, including 10 laws, regulations, and applicable standards, of the Remote State where the client is 11 located at the time care is rendered. 12 (B) Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any 13 other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with the Compact. 14 (C) Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a 15 Member State in conflict with the Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. 16 (D) All permissible agreements between the Commission and the 17 Member States are binding in accordance with their terms. 18 * Sec. 7.
