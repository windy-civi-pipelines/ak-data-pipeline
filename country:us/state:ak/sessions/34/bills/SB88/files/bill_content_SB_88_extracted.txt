A party or child's foster parent who is opposed to the proposed transfer may 11 request a hearing and must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the transfer 12 would be contrary to the best interests of the child for the court to deny the transfer. A 13 foster parent may obtain, at the foster parent's cost, a medical or psychological 14 evaluation of the child for the purpose of providing evidence at the hearing. A 01 foster parent who requests a hearing to oppose a proposed transfer under this 02 subsection does not become a party to the case. A foster parent or out-of-home 03 caregiver who requests a nonemergency change in placement of the child shall provide 04 the department with reasonable advance notice of the requested change. When the 05 department transfers a child from one out-of-home placement to another, the 06 department shall search as provided under AS 47.10.145 for an appropriate 07 placement with an adult family member or a family friend who meets the foster care 08 licensing requirements established by the department. A supervisor at the department 09 shall certify in writing in the case file whether the department has searched for an 10 appropriate placement with an adult family member or family friend. If the department 11 has not complied with the search requirements under this subsection, the supervisor 12 shall work to ensure that the department completes the search in the shortest time 13 feasible. 14 * Sec. 2. AS 47.10.084(d) is amended to read: 15 (d) When the child is placed in foster care, the foster parent has the right and 16 responsibility to use a reasonable and prudent parent standard to make decisions 17 relating to the child.

If an adult family member of the 13 child requests that the department approve the adult family member for an adoption, 14 the department shall approve the request if it is in the best interests of the child. In 15 determining the best interests of the child under this subsection, the department 16 shall consider the child's physical and psychological well-being. In determining 17 the best interests of a child under six years of age, the department shall consider 18 whether the child has resided for at least 12 consecutive months with a foster 19 family seeking adoption and whether an adult family member seeking adoption 20 has previously demonstrated an intent or desire to be considered for placement 21 for the child [UNLESS THERE IS GOOD CAUSE NOT TO APPROVE THE 22 ADOPTION].
