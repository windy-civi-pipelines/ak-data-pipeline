AS 23.20.378(c) is amended to read: 13 (c) An insured worker is disqualified for [WAITING-WEEK CREDIT OR] 14 benefits for a week of unemployment while the insured worker is pursuing an 15 academic education. A disqualification under this subsection begins with the first 16 week of academic instruction and ends with the week immediately before the first full 17 week in which the insured worker is no longer pursuing an academic education. 18 However, an insured worker who has been pursuing an academic education for at least 19 one school term and who was working at least 30 hours a week during a significant 20 portion of the time that the worker was pursuing an academic education is not 21 disqualified for [WAITING-WEEK CREDIT OR] benefits under this subsection if the 22 worker's academic schedule does not preclude full-time work in the worker's 23 occupation and if the insured worker became unemployed because the worker was laid 24 off or the worker's job was eliminated.
