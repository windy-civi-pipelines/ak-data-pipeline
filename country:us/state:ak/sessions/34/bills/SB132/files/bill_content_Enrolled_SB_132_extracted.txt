AS 21.06.120(a) is amended to read: 11 (a) The director may examine the affairs, transactions, accounts, records, and 12 assets of each authorized and formerly authorized insurer and each licensed and 13 formerly licensed managing general agent, reinsurance intermediary broker, 14 reinsurance intermediary manager, surplus lines broker, pharmacy benefits manager, 15 and surplus lines association as often as the director considers advisable. In scheduling 01 and determining the nature, scope, and frequency of examinations, the director may 02 consider any factor or material that the director determines is appropriate, including 03 the results of financial statement analysis and ratios, competency of management or 04 change of ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent certified public 05 accountants, number and nature of consumer complaints, results of prior examinations, 06 frequency of prior violations of statute and regulation, and criteria set out in the most 07 recent edition of the Financial Condition Examiners Handbook and the Market 08 Regulation Handbook approved by the National Association of Insurance 09 Commissioners and in effect when the director conducts an examination. Examination 10 of an alien insurer may be limited to its insurance transactions and affairs in the United 11 States. Examination of a reciprocal insurer may also include examination of its 12 attorney-in-fact to the extent that the transactions of the attorney-in-fact relate to the 13 insurer. 14 * Sec. 3. AS 21.06.120(d) is amended to read: 15 (d) The director may examine insurers, third-party administrators, and 16 pharmacy benefits managers in participation with the National Association of 17 Insurance Commissioners. 18 * Sec. 4. AS 21.06.120 is amended by adding a new subsection to read: 19 (h) The director may examine a third-party administrator or pharmacy benefits 20 manager any time the director determines that an examination or investigation is 21 necessary. 22 * Sec. 5. AS 21.06.160(a) is amended to read: 23 (a) Each person examined, other than examinations under AS 21.06.130 and 24 examinations of managing general agents, [THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATORS,] 25 reinsurance intermediary managers, motor vehicle service contract providers, or 26 surplus lines brokers, shall pay a reasonable rate calculated on salary, benefit costs, 27 and estimated division overhead for time spent directly or indirectly related to the 28 examination. Each person examined, other than examinations under AS 21.06.130, 29 shall pay actual out-of-pocket business expenses, including travel expenses, incurred 30 by division staff examiners and shall pay the compensation of a contract examiner, to 31 be set at a reasonable customary rate, for conducting the examination upon 01 presentation of a detailed account of the charges and expenses by the director or under 02 an order of the director. The director may waive payment of all or part of the actual 03 out-of-pocket business expenses incurred by division staff examiners, or the 04 compensation of a contract examiner, if the director determines that payment of the 05 expenses or compensation creates a financial hardship for a managing general agent, 06 third-party administrator, reinsurance intermediary manager, motor vehicle service 07 contract provider, or surplus lines broker. The accounting may either be presented 08 periodically during the course of the examination or at the termination of the 09 examination. A person may not pay and an examiner may not accept additional 10 compensation for an examination. A person shall pay examination expenses to the 11 division under this subsection using an electronic payment method specified by the 12 director. 13 * Sec. 6. AS 21.07.030(a) is amended to read: 14 (a) If a health care insurer offers a health care insurance policy that provides 15 for coverage of medical care services only if the services are furnished through a 16 network of health care providers that have entered into a contract with the health care 17 insurer, the health care insurer shall also offer a non-network option to covered 18 persons at initial enrollment, as provided under (c) of this section. The non-network 19 option may require that a covered person pay a higher deductible, copayment, or 20 premium for the plan if the higher deductible, copayment, or premium results from 21 increased costs caused by the use of a non-network provider. This subsection does not 22 apply to 23 (1) a covered person who is offered non-network coverage through 24 another health care insurance policy or through another health care insurer; or 25 (2) a health maintenance organization licensed under AS 21.86. 26 * Sec. 7. AS 21.07.030 is amended by adding a new subsection to read: 27 (i) A health care insurer that offers a health care insurance policy that provides 28 different levels of coverage for health care services based on network status and 29 performs utilization review shall include details on a prior authorization request form 30 on how a health care provider or covered person may request a benefit-level 31 exception. If the health care insurer approves the prior authorization, the insurer shall 01 detail whether the claim will be processed as a network or non-network claim. If the 02 benefit will be paid based on a non-network reimbursement level and a benefit-level 03 exception requires an application process separate from the prior authorization 04 process, the prior authorization must include instructions for requesting the benefit- 05 level exception. In this subsection, a "benefit-level exception" means an exception to 06 medical care coverage where a health care insurer applies network health care benefit 07 levels to services received from an out-of-network health care provider or facility. 08 * Sec. 8.

THE 15 FILING DATE FOR THE ANNUAL AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORT MAY BE 16 EXTENDED BY THE DIRECTOR UPON SHOWING THAT THE STANDARDS 17 ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION HAVE BEEN MET]. If the director gives the 18 insurer 90 days' advance notice, and for good cause, the director may require an 19 insurer to file an audited financial report earlier than June 1 of each year. The annual 20 audited financial report must be prepared by a qualified independent certified public 21 accountant. An insurer shall notify the director of the certified public accountant 22 engaged to conduct the audit and issue the annual audited financial report. 23 * Sec. 9. AS 21.09.200 is amended by adding a new subsection to read: 24 (m) An insurer may apply to the director for an exemption from compliance 25 with a requirement of this section if compliance would cause the insurer to suffer a 26 financial or organizational hardship. The director may, in the director's discretion, 27 approve an exemption. If the director denies an insurer's application for exemption, the 28 insurer may, within 15 days after the date of the denial, submit a request in writing to 29 the director for a hearing as provided under AS 21.06.180 - 21.06.240. 30 * Sec. 10. AS 21.09.210(b) is amended to read: 31 (b) Each insurer, and each formerly authorized insurer with respect to 01 premiums written while an authorized insurer in this state, shall pay a tax on the total 02 direct premium written during the year ending on the preceding December 31 and paid 03 for the insurance of property or risks resident or located in the state [, OTHER THAN 04 WET MARINE AND TRANSPORTATION INSURANCE,] after deducting from the 05 total direct premium income the applicable cancellations, returned premiums, the 06 unabsorbed portion of any deposit premium, all policy dividends, unabsorbed 07 premiums refunded to policyholders, refunds, savings, savings coupons, and other 08 similar returns paid or credited to policyholders with respect to their policies. 09 Deductions may not be made of cash surrender value of policies. Considerations 10 received on annuity contracts are not included in the direct premium income and are 11 not subject to tax. The tax shall be paid to the director at least annually but not more 12 often than once each quarter on the dates specified by the director. The method of 13 payment must be by the electronic or other payment method specified by the director. 14 Except as provided under (m) of this section, the tax is computed at the rate of 15 (1) for domestic and foreign insurers, except hospital and medical 16 service corporations, 2.7 percent; 17 (2) for hospital and medical service corporations, six percent of their 18 gross premiums less claims paid; 19 (3) for wet marine and transportation insurance, three-quarters of 20 one percent. 21 * Sec. 11. AS 21.09.242(a) is amended to read: 22 (a) Each [AN] insurer and [, INCLUDING A] pharmacy benefits manager 23 shall, with respect to a medical assistance program [PROGRAMS] under AS 47.07, 24 [SHALL] cooperate with the Department of Health to 25 (1) provide, with respect to an individual who is eligible for or is 26 provided medical assistance under AS 47.07, at [ON] the request of the department, 27 information to determine during what period the individual or the individual's spouse 28 or dependents may be or may have been covered by the insurer and the nature of the 29 coverage that is or was provided by the insurer, including the name and address of the 30 insurer and the identifying number of the health care insurance plan; 31 (2) accept the department's right of recovery and the assignment to the 01 department of any right of an individual or other entity to payment from the party for 02 an item or service for which payment has been made under AS 47.07; 03 (3) respond within 60 days to any inquiry by the department regarding 04 a claim for payment for any health care item or service that is submitted not later than 05 three years after the date of the provision of the health care item or service; and 06 (4) agree not to deny a claim submitted by the department solely on the 07 basis of the date of submission of the claim, the type or format of the claim form, a 08 failure to obtain prior authorization, or a failure to present proper documentation at 09 the point-of-sale that is the basis of the claim if 10 (A) the claim is submitted by the department within the three- 11 year period beginning on the date on which the item or service was furnished; 12 and 13 (B) any action by the department to enforce its rights with 14 respect to the claim is commenced within six years after the department's 15 submission of the claim. 16 * Sec. 12. AS 21.12.020(h) is amended to read: 17 (h) The director shall consider the list of reciprocal jurisdictions published 18 through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners committee process in 19 determining a reciprocal jurisdiction and has the discretion to defer to the list. The 20 director may approve a jurisdiction not on the list in accordance with criteria 21 developed under regulations adopted by the director. The director may remove a 22 jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon determination that the 23 jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction in accordance 24 with a process set out in regulation by the director. Upon removal of a reciprocal 25 jurisdiction from the list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that has a 26 home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed if otherwise allowed 27 under this section. The director shall timely create and publish a list of assuming 28 insurers that have satisfied the conditions set out in this subsection and to which 29 cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with (a) of this section. The director 30 may add an assuming insurer to a list if a National Association of Insurance 31 Commissioners accredited jurisdiction has added the assuming insurer to a list of 01 assuming insurers or, if upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the 02 information to the director as required under (a)(6)(D) of this section and complies 03 with any additional requirements the director may impose by regulation. If the director 04 determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements 05 of (a)(6) of this section, the director may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the 06 assuming insurer under (a)(6) of this section in accordance with procedures set out in 07 regulation. While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, a reinsurance 08 agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of the suspension does 09 not qualify for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under 10 the contract are secured in accordance with (c) of this section. If an assuming insurer's 11 eligibility is revoked, a credit for reinsurance may not be granted after the effective 12 date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreement entered into by the 13 assuming insurer, including a reinsurance agreement entered into before the date of 14 revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the 15 contract are secured in a form acceptable to the director and consistent with (c) of this 16 section. Upon entry of an order of rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation against 17 the ceding insurer, the supervising court may [SHALL] require an assuming insurer 18 under (a)(6) of this section to post 100 percent security for the benefit of the ceding 19 insurer or its estate. Nothing in this subsection shall limit or in any way alter the 20 capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or 21 other terms in that reinsurance agreement consistent with this section. Credit under 22 (a)(6) of this section may be taken only for reinsurance agreements entered into, 23 renewed, or amended on or after the date the director has determined that the assuming 24 insurer is eligible for credit, and may not be taken for reinsurance of losses incurred or 25 reserves reported before that date. Credit under (a)(6) of this section may not apply to 26 reinsurance agreements entered into, to losses incurred, or to reserves posted before 27 application under (a)(6) of this section. 28 * Sec. 13.

Examination of a reciprocal insurer may also include examination of its 12 attorney-in-fact to the extent that the transactions of the attorney-in-fact relate to the 13 insurer. 14 * Sec. 3. AS 21.06.120(d) is amended to read: 15 (d) The director may examine insurers, third-party administrators, and 16 pharmacy benefits managers in participation with the National Association of 17 Insurance Commissioners. 18 * Sec. 4.

The director may waive payment of all or part of the actual 03 out-of-pocket business expenses incurred by division staff examiners, or the 04 compensation of a contract examiner, if the director determines that payment of the 05 expenses or compensation creates a financial hardship for a managing general agent, 06 third-party administrator, reinsurance intermediary manager, motor vehicle service 07 contract provider, or surplus lines broker.

The non-network 19 option may require that a covered person pay a higher deductible, copayment, or 20 premium for the plan if the higher deductible, copayment, or premium results from 21 increased costs caused by the use of a non-network provider. This subsection does not 22 apply to 23 (1) a covered person who is offered non-network coverage through 24 another health care insurance policy or through another health care insurer; or 25 (2) a health maintenance organization licensed under AS 21.86. 26 * Sec. 7.

If the health care insurer approves the prior authorization, the insurer shall 01 detail whether the claim will be processed as a network or non-network claim. If the 02 benefit will be paid based on a non-network reimbursement level and a benefit-level 03 exception requires an application process separate from the prior authorization 04 process, the prior authorization must include instructions for requesting the benefit- 05 level exception.

The annual 20 audited financial report must be prepared by a qualified independent certified public 21 accountant.

The director may remove a 22 jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon determination that the 23 jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction in accordance 24 with a process set out in regulation by the director.

The director shall timely create and publish a list of assuming 28 insurers that have satisfied the conditions set out in this subsection and to which 29 cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with (a) of this section. The director 30 may add an assuming insurer to a list if a National Association of Insurance 31 Commissioners accredited jurisdiction has added the assuming insurer to a list of 01 assuming insurers or, if upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the 02 information to the director as required under (a)(6)(D) of this section and complies 03 with any additional requirements the director may impose by regulation.

Credit under 22 (a)(6) of this section may be taken only for reinsurance agreements entered into, 23 renewed, or amended on or after the date the director has determined that the assuming 24 insurer is eligible for credit, and may not be taken for reinsurance of losses incurred or 25 reserves reported before that date. Credit under (a)(6) of this section may not apply to 26 reinsurance agreements entered into, to losses incurred, or to reserves posted before 27 application under (a)(6) of this section. 28 * Sec. 13.
