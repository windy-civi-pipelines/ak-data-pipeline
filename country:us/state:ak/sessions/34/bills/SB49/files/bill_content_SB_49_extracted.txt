(a) An 09 employer may file a petition in the district or superior court for a protective order 10 against an individual who the employer reasonably believes 11 (1) committed an act of violence against the employer or an employee 12 that occurred at the employer's workplace; or 13 (2) made a threat of violence against the employer or an employee that 14 can reasonably be construed as a threat that may be carried out at the employer's 15 workplace. 16 (b) When a petition for a protective order is filed, the court shall schedule a 17 hearing and provide at least 10 days' notice to the respondent of the hearing and of the 18 respondent's right to appear and be heard, either in person or through an attorney. If 19 the court finds by a preponderance of evidence that the respondent has committed 20 violence or made a threat of violence, regardless of whether the respondent appears at 21 the hearing, the court may order any relief available under (c) of this section. The 22 provisions of a protective order issued under this section are effective for six months 23 unless earlier dissolved by the court. 24 (c) A protective order issued under this section may 25 (1) prohibit the respondent from making a threat to commit or 26 committing violence; 27 (2) prohibit the respondent from telephoning, contacting, or otherwise 28 communicating directly or indirectly with the petitioner; 29 (3) direct the respondent to stay away from the workplace of the 30 petitioner, or space adjacent to the workplace of the petitioner, or any specified place 31 frequented by the petitioner, during the normal course of the petitioner's business; 01 however, the court may order the respondent to stay away from the respondent's own 02 workplace only if the respondent has been provided actual notice of the opportunity to 03 appear and be heard on the petition; 04 (4) order other relief the court determines to be necessary to protect the 05 workplace of the petitioner. 06 (d) If the court issues a protective order under this section, the court shall 07 (1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by 08 the petitioner and the respondent; and 09 (2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement 10 agency for expedited service and entry into the central registry of protective orders 11 under AS 18.65.540. 12 (e) A court may not deny a petition for a protective order solely because of a 13 lapse of time between an act of violence or a threat of violence and the filing of the 14 petition. 15 Sec. 18.65.877. Ex parte protective orders for workplace violence. An 16 employer who may file a petition for a protective order against an individual under 17 AS 18.65.875 may file a petition for an ex parte protective order against the 18 individual.

An ex parte protective order under this section may grant the 24 protection allowed by AS 18.65.875(c). An ex parte protective order expires 20 days 25 after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of either the 26 petitioner or the respondent after notice and, if requested, a hearing.

A petitioner is not barred from 08 seeking an order under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899 because of the existence of another 09 civil action between the petitioner and the respondent. 10 Sec. 18.65.890.

The 22 provisions of a protective order issued under this section are effective for six months 23 unless earlier dissolved by the court. 24 (c) A protective order issued under this section may 25 (1) prohibit the respondent from making a threat to commit or 26 committing violence; 27 (2) prohibit the respondent from telephoning, contacting, or otherwise 28 communicating directly or indirectly with the petitioner; 29 (3) direct the respondent to stay away from the workplace of the 30 petitioner, or space adjacent to the workplace of the petitioner, or any specified place 31 frequented by the petitioner, during the normal course of the petitioner's business; 01 however, the court may order the respondent to stay away from the respondent's own 02 workplace only if the respondent has been provided actual notice of the opportunity to 03 appear and be heard on the petition; 04 (4) order other relief the court determines to be necessary to protect the 05 workplace of the petitioner. 06 (d) If the court issues a protective order under this section, the court shall 07 (1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by 08 the petitioner and the respondent; and 09 (2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement 10 agency for expedited service and entry into the central registry of protective orders 11 under AS 18.65.540. 12 (e) A court may not deny a petition for a protective order solely because of a 13 lapse of time between an act of violence or a threat of violence and the filing of the 14 petition. 15 Sec. 18.65.877. Ex parte protective orders for workplace violence. An 16 employer who may file a petition for a protective order against an individual under 17 AS 18.65.875 may file a petition for an ex parte protective order against the 18 individual. If the court finds that the petition establishes probable cause that recent 19 violence has occurred or a recent threat of violence has been made, that it is necessary 20 to protect the employer from further violence, and that the petitioner has certified to 21 the court in writing the efforts, if any, that have been made to provide notice to the 22 respondent, the court shall ex parte and without notice to the respondent issue a 23 protective order. An ex parte protective order under this section may grant the 24 protection allowed by AS 18.65.875(c). An ex parte protective order expires 20 days 25 after it is issued unless dissolved earlier by the court at the request of either the 26 petitioner or the respondent after notice and, if requested, a hearing. If the court issues 27 an ex parte protective order, the court shall have the order delivered to the appropriate 28 law enforcement agency for expedited service and entry into the central registry of 29 protective orders under AS 18.65.540. 30 Sec. 18.65.880. Modification of workplace violence protective order. (a) 31 Either the petitioner or the respondent may request modification of a protective order 01 issued under AS 18.65.875 or 18.65.877. If a request is made for modification of 02 (1) a protective order after notice and hearing under AS 18.65.875, the 03 court shall schedule a hearing within 20 days after the date the request is made, except 04 that if the court finds that the request is meritless on its face, the court may deny the 05 request without further hearing; or 06 (2) an ex parte protective order under AS 18.65.877, the court shall 07 schedule a hearing on three days' notice or on shorter notice as the court may 08 prescribe. 09 (b) If a request for a modification is made under this section and the 10 respondent raises an issue not raised by the petitioner, the court may allow the 11 petitioner additional time to respond. 12 (c) If the court modifies a protective order under this section, the court shall 13 issue a modified order and shall 14 (1) make reasonable efforts to ensure that the order is understood by 15 the petitioner and the respondent; and 16 (2) have the order delivered to the appropriate local law enforcement 17 agency for expedited service and for entry into the central registry of protective orders 18 under AS 18.65.540. 19 Sec. 18.65.885. Specific protective orders. (a) If a respondent in a protective 20 order issued under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.880 is prohibited from communicating with 21 the petitioner, excluded from the petitioner's workplace or space adjacent to the 22 petitioner's workplace, or ordered to stay away from the petitioner as provided in 23 AS 18.65.875(c)(2) - (4), an invitation by the petitioner to communicate, enter the 24 petitioner's workplace, or have other prohibited contact with the petitioner does not 25 waive or nullify any provision in a protective order. 26 (b) A court may not order parties into mediation or refer them to mediation for 27 resolution of the issues arising from a petition for a protective order under 28 AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899. 29 (c) In addition to other required information contained in a protective order, 30 the order must include in boldface type the following statements: 31 (1) "Violation of this order may be a misdemeanor, punishable by up 01 to one year of incarceration and up to a $25,000 fine"; 02 (2) "If you are ordered to have no contact with the petitioner or to stay 03 away from the petitioner's workplace or other place designated by the court, an 04 invitation by the petitioner to have the prohibited contact or to be present at or enter 05 the workplace or other place does not in any way invalidate or nullify the order." 06 (d) A protective order issued under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899 is in addition to 07 and not in place of any other civil or criminal remedy. A petitioner is not barred from 08 seeking an order under AS 18.65.875 - 18.65.899 because of the existence of another 09 civil action between the petitioner and the respondent. 10 Sec. 18.65.890.
