The application must be made on a 10 form prescribed or approved by the director. The voter or registration official shall 11 submit the application directly to the division of elections. For purposes of this 12 subsection, "directly to the division of elections" means that an application may not be 13 submitted to any intermediary that could control or delay the submission of the 14 application to the division or gather data on the applicant from the application form. 15 However, nothing in this subsection is intended to prohibit a voter from giving a 16 completed absentee ballot application to a friend, relative, or associate for transfer to 17 the United States Postal Service or a private commercial delivery service for delivery 18 to the division. 19 * Sec. 14.

[IN A GENERAL 23 ELECTION, A VOTER MAY MARK A BALLOT THAT REQUIRES THE VOTER 24 TO VOTE FOR CANDIDATES IN ORDER OF RANKED PREFERENCE BY THE 25 USE OF NUMERALS THAT ARE CLEARLY SPACED IN ONE OF THE OVALS 26 OPPOSITE THE NAME OF THE CANDIDATE THAT THE VOTER DESIRES TO 27 DESIGNATE.] 28 (2) A failure to properly mark a ballot as to one or more candidates 29 does not itself invalidate the entire ballot. 30 (3) If a voter marks fewer names than there are persons to be 31 elected to the office, a vote shall be counted for each candidate properly marked. 01 (4) If a voter marks more names than there are persons to be elected to 02 the office, the votes for candidates for that office may not be counted. 03 (5) [(4)] The mark specified in (1) of this subsection shall be counted 04 only if it is substantially inside the oval provided, or touching the oval so as to indicate 05 clearly that the voter intended the particular oval to be designated. 06 (6) [(5)] Improper marks on the ballot may not be counted and do not 07 invalidate marks for candidates properly made. 08 (7) [(6)] An erasure or correction invalidates only that section of the 09 ballot in which it appears. 10 (8) [(7)] A vote marked for the candidate for President or Vice- 11 President of the United States is considered and counted as a vote for the election of 12 the presidential electors. 13 [(9) REPEALED 14 (10) REPEALED 15 (11) REPEALED 16 (12) REPEALED] 17 * Sec. 11. AS 15.15.370 is amended to read: 18 Sec. 15.15.370. Completion of ballot count; certificate. When the count of 19 ballots is completed, and in no event later than the day after the election, the election 20 board shall make a certificate in duplicate of the results. The certificate includes the 21 number of votes cast for each candidate, [INCLUDING, FOR A CANDIDATE IN A 22 GENERAL ELECTION, THE NUMBER OF VOTES AT EACH ROUND OF THE 23 RANKED-CHOICE TABULATION PROCESS UNDER AS 15.15.350, THE 24 NUMBER OF VOTES] for and against each proposition, yes or no on each question, 25 and any additional information prescribed by the director. The election board shall, 26 immediately upon completion of the certificate or as soon thereafter as the local mail 27 service permits, send in one sealed package to the director one copy of the certificate 28 and the register. In addition, all ballots properly cast shall be mailed to the director in a 29 separate, sealed package. Both packages, in addition to an address on the outside, shall 30 clearly indicate the precinct from which they come. Each board shall, immediately 31 upon completion of the certification and as soon thereafter as the local mail service 01 permits, send the duplicate certificate to the respective election supervisor. The 02 director may authorize election boards in precincts in those areas of the state where 03 distance and weather make mail communication unreliable to forward their election 04 results by telephone or radio. The director may authorize the unofficial totaling of 05 votes on a regional basis by election supervisors, tallying the votes as indicated on 06 duplicate certificates. To ensure adequate protection, the director shall prescribe the 07 manner in which the ballots, registers, and all other election records and materials are 08 thereafter preserved, transferred, and destroyed. 09 * Sec. 12. AS 15.15.450 is amended to read: 10 Sec. 15.15.450. Certification of state ballot counting review. Upon 11 completion of the state ballot counting review, the director shall certify the person 12 receiving the largest number of votes for the office for which that person was a 13 candidate as elected to that office [NOMINATED OR ELECTED, AS 14 APPLICABLE,] and shall certify the approval of a justice or judge not rejected by a 15 majority of the voters voting on the question. The director shall issue to the elected 16 candidates and approved justices and judges a certificate of their election or approval. 17 The director shall also certify the results of a proposition and other question except 18 that the lieutenant governor shall certify the results of an initiative, referendum, or 19 constitutional amendment. 20 * Sec. 13. AS 15.20.081(a) is amended to read: 21 (a) A qualified voter may apply in person, by mail, or by facsimile, scanning, 22 or other electronic transmission to the director for an absentee ballot under this 23 section. Another individual may apply for an absentee ballot on behalf of a qualified 24 voter if that individual is designated to act on behalf of the voter in a written general 25 power of attorney or a written special power of attorney that authorizes the other 26 individual to apply for an absentee ballot on behalf of the voter. The application must 27 include the address or, if the application requests delivery of an absentee ballot by 28 electronic transmission, the telephone electronic transmission number, to which the 29 absentee ballot is to be returned, the applicant's full Alaska residence address, and the 30 applicant's signature.

Only the voter or the individual designated by the voter in a 05 written power of attorney under this subsection may mark the voter's choice of 06 primary ballot on an application. A person supplying an absentee ballot 07 application form may not design or mark the application in a manner that 08 suggests choice of one ballot over another, except that ballot choices may be listed 09 on an application as authorized by the division. The application must be made on a 10 form prescribed or approved by the director. The voter or registration official shall 11 submit the application directly to the division of elections. For purposes of this 12 subsection, "directly to the division of elections" means that an application may not be 13 submitted to any intermediary that could control or delay the submission of the 14 application to the division or gather data on the applicant from the application form. 15 However, nothing in this subsection is intended to prohibit a voter from giving a 16 completed absentee ballot application to a friend, relative, or associate for transfer to 17 the United States Postal Service or a private commercial delivery service for delivery 18 to the division. 19 * Sec. 14. AS 15.20.081(h) is amended to read: 20 (h) Except as provided in AS 15.20.480, an absentee ballot returned by mail 21 from outside the United States or from an overseas voter qualifying under 22 AS 15.05.011 that has been marked and mailed not later than election day may not be 23 counted unless the ballot is received by the election supervisor not later than the close 24 of business on the 25 (1) 10th day following a primary election or special [PRIMARY] 26 election under AS 15.40.140; or 27 (2) 15th day following a general election, special runoff election, or 28 special election, other than a special [PRIMARY] election described in (1) of this 29 subsection. 30 * Sec. 15.
