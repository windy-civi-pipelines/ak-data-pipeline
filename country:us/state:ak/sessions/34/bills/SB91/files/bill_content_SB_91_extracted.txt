Before land may be offered under 09 AS 38.08 or AS 38.09, or before land may be offered under AS 38.05.055 or 10 38.05.057, except land that is classified for agricultural uses, an official rectangular 11 survey grid shall be established. The rectangular survey section corner positions shall 12 be monumented and shown on a cadastral survey plat approved by the state. For those 13 areas where the state may wish to convey surface estate outside of an official 14 rectangular survey grid, the commissioner may waive monumentation of individual 01 section corner positions and substitute an official control survey with control points 02 being monumented and shown on control survey plats approved by the state. The 03 commissioner may not issue more than one conveyance for each section within a 04 township outside of an official rectangular survey grid. Land to be conveyed may not 05 be located more than two miles from an official survey control monument except that 06 the commissioner may waive this requirement on a determination that a single purpose 07 use does not justify the requirement if the existing status of the land is known with 08 reasonable certainty. The lots and tracts in state subdivisions shall be monumented and 09 the cadastral survey and plats for the subdivision shall be approved by the state. Where 10 land is located within a municipality with planning, platting, and zoning powers, plats 11 for state subdivisions shall comply with local ordinances and regulations in the same 12 manner and to the same extent as plats for subdivisions by other landowners. State 13 subdivisions shall be filed and recorded in the district recorder's office. The 14 requirements of this section do not apply to land made available for material sales, for 15 short-term leases, or for parcels adjoining a surveyed right-of-way, to land subject to 16 a clean energy project development license issued under AS 38.05.410, or to 17 [FOR] land that has been open to random staking under the homestead program in the 18 past; however, for short-term leases, the lessee shall comply with local subdivision 19 ordinances unless waived by the municipality under procedures specified by 20 ordinance.

Bonding. Before the commissioner may issue a clean energy 02 project development license under AS 38.05.410 or a lease under AS 38.05.430, an 03 applicant for a license under AS 38.05.410(e) or lease under AS 38.05.430(a) shall 04 post a performance bond or provide other security acceptable to the commissioner to 05 cover the costs to the department of one or more of the following, as determined by 06 the commissioner: 07 (1) administering and managing the license or lease to ensure 08 completion of the clean energy project and compliance with the terms and conditions 09 of the license or lease; 10 (2) administrating and managing the license or lease to ensure that 11 development occurs according to the terms and conditions of the license or lease; and 12 (3) restoring the land at the conclusion of the license period or lease 13 term, upon the termination of the license or lease, or upon a finding that work 14 associated with the clean energy project has been abandoned. 15 Sec. 38.05.450.

Land to be conveyed may not 05 be located more than two miles from an official survey control monument except that 06 the commissioner may waive this requirement on a determination that a single purpose 07 use does not justify the requirement if the existing status of the land is known with 08 reasonable certainty. The lots and tracts in state subdivisions shall be monumented and 09 the cadastral survey and plats for the subdivision shall be approved by the state. Where 10 land is located within a municipality with planning, platting, and zoning powers, plats 11 for state subdivisions shall comply with local ordinances and regulations in the same 12 manner and to the same extent as plats for subdivisions by other landowners.
