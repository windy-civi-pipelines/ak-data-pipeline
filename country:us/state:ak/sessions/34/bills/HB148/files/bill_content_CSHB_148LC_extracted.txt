AS 12.10.020 is amended by adding a new subsection to read: 04 (d) Even if the general time limitation has expired, a prosecution for any 05 offense related to life insurance may be commenced within one year after discovery of 06 the offense by an aggrieved party or by a person who has legal capacity to represent an 07 aggrieved party or a legal duty to report the offense and who is not a party to the 08 offense, but in no case shall this provision extend the period of limitation otherwise 09 applicable by more than 20 years. 10 * Sec. 2. AS 21.07.030(a) is amended to read: 11 (a) If a health care insurer offers a health care insurance policy that provides 12 for coverage of medical care services only if the services are furnished through a 13 network of health care providers that have entered into a contract with the health care 14 insurer, the health care insurer shall also offer a non-network option to covered 15 persons at initial enrollment, as provided under (c) of this section. The non-network 01 option may require that a covered person pay a higher deductible, copayment, or 02 premium for the plan if the higher deductible, copayment, or premium results from 03 increased costs caused by the use of a non-network provider. This subsection does not 04 apply to 05 (1) a covered person who is offered non-network coverage through 06 another health care insurance policy or through another health care insurer; or 07 (2) a health maintenance organization licensed under AS 21.86. 08 * Sec. 3. AS 21.07.030 is amended by adding a new subsection to read: 09 (i) A health care insurer that offers a health care insurance policy that provides 10 different levels of coverage for health care services based on network status and 11 performs utilization review shall include details on a prior authorization request form 12 on how a health care provider or covered person may request a benefit-level 13 exception. If the health care insurer approves the prior authorization, the insurer shall 14 detail whether the claim will be processed as a network or non-network claim. If the 15 benefit will be paid based on a non-network reimbursement level and a benefit-level 16 exception requires an application process separate from the prior authorization 17 process, the prior authorization must include instructions for requesting the benefit- 18 level exception. In this subsection, a "benefit-level exception" means an exception to 19 medical care coverage where a health care insurer applies network health care benefit 20 levels to services received from an out-of-network health care provider or facility. 21 * Sec. 4. AS 21.09.200(g) is amended to read: 22 (g) An insurer shall file with the director or the director's designee an annual 23 audited financial report for the previous year by June 1 of each year [UNLESS, 24 UNDER A REGULATION ADOPTED BY THE DIRECTOR, THE DIRECTOR 25 GRANTS AN EXEMPTION BASED ON A FINDING THAT FILING AN 26 ANNUAL AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORT WOULD CONSTITUTE A 27 FINANCIAL OR ORGANIZATIONAL HARDSHIP ON THE INSURER. THE 28 FILING DATE FOR THE ANNUAL AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORT MAY BE 29 EXTENDED BY THE DIRECTOR UPON SHOWING THAT THE STANDARDS 30 ESTABLISHED BY REGULATION HAVE BEEN MET].

The 02 director may approve a jurisdiction not on the list in accordance with criteria 03 developed under regulations adopted by the director. The director may remove a 04 jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions upon determination that the 05 jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction in accordance 06 with a process set out in regulation by the director. Upon removal of a reciprocal 07 jurisdiction from the list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that has a 08 home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed if otherwise allowed 09 under this section. The director shall timely create and publish a list of assuming 10 insurers that have satisfied the conditions set out in this subsection and to which 11 cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with (a) of this section. The director 12 may add an assuming insurer to a list if a National Association of Insurance 13 Commissioners accredited jurisdiction has added the assuming insurer to a list of 14 assuming insurers or, if upon initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the 15 information to the director as required under (a)(6)(D) of this section and complies 16 with any additional requirements the director may impose by regulation. If the director 17 determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements 18 of (a)(6) of this section, the director may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the 19 assuming insurer under (a)(6) of this section in accordance with procedures set out in 20 regulation. While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, a reinsurance 21 agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of the suspension does 22 not qualify for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under 23 the contract are secured in accordance with (c) of this section. If an assuming insurer's 24 eligibility is revoked, a credit for reinsurance may not be granted after the effective 25 date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreement entered into by the 26 assuming insurer, including a reinsurance agreement entered into before the date of 27 revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the 28 contract are secured in a form acceptable to the director and consistent with (c) of this 29 section.

Nothing in this subsection shall limit or in any way alter the 02 capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or 03 other terms in that reinsurance agreement consistent with this section. Credit under 04 (a)(6) of this section may be taken only for reinsurance agreements entered into, 05 renewed, or amended on or after the date the director has determined that the assuming 06 insurer is eligible for credit, and may not be taken for reinsurance of losses incurred or 07 reserves reported before that date. Credit under (a)(6) of this section may not apply to 08 reinsurance agreements entered into, to losses incurred, or to reserves posted before 09 application under (a)(6) of this section. 10 * Sec. 9.

AS 21.07.030(a) is amended to read: 11 (a) If a health care insurer offers a health care insurance policy that provides 12 for coverage of medical care services only if the services are furnished through a 13 network of health care providers that have entered into a contract with the health care 14 insurer, the health care insurer shall also offer a non-network option to covered 15 persons at initial enrollment, as provided under (c) of this section. The non-network 01 option may require that a covered person pay a higher deductible, copayment, or 02 premium for the plan if the higher deductible, copayment, or premium results from 03 increased costs caused by the use of a non-network provider. This subsection does not 04 apply to 05 (1) a covered person who is offered non-network coverage through 06 another health care insurance policy or through another health care insurer; or 07 (2) a health maintenance organization licensed under AS 21.86. 08 * Sec. 3.

If the director 17 determines that an assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements 18 of (a)(6) of this section, the director may revoke or suspend the eligibility of the 19 assuming insurer under (a)(6) of this section in accordance with procedures set out in 20 regulation. While an assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, a reinsurance 21 agreement issued, amended, or renewed after the effective date of the suspension does 22 not qualify for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under 23 the contract are secured in accordance with (c) of this section.
