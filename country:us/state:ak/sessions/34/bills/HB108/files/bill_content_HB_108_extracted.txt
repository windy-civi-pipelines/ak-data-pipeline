A 09 transfer is not commissionable or subject to other fees and may be in the form of cash or a 10 security as determined by the board. A security shall be valued on the date of receipt in the 11 member's account. 12 (d) If the value actuarially calculated under (c) of this section is insufficient to pay for 13 service credit equal to the member's actual service, the administrator shall allow the member 14 the option of creating an indebtedness up to the amount needed to eliminate the insufficiency; 15 however, if that value exceeds the amount needed to pay for a service credit equal to the 16 member's actual service, the administrator shall cause the excess to remain in the member's 17 retirement plan established under AS 39.35.700 - 39.35.990.
