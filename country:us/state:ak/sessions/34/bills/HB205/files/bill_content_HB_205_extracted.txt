AS 31.05.170(15) is amended to read: 06 (15) "waste" means, in addition to its ordinary meaning, physical 07 waste ["PHYSICAL WASTE"] and includes 08 (A) the inefficient, excessive, or improper use of, or 09 unnecessary dissipation of, reservoir energy; and the locating, spacing, drilling, 10 equipping, operating or producing of any oil or gas well in a manner that 11 [WHICH] results or tends to result in reducing the quantity of oil or gas to be 12 recovered from a pool in this state under operations conducted in accordance 13 with good oil field engineering practices; 14 (B) the inefficient above-ground storage of oil; and the 01 locating, spacing, drilling, equipping, operating, or producing of an oil or gas 02 well in a manner causing, or tending to cause, unnecessary or excessive surface 03 loss or destruction of oil or gas; 04 (C) producing oil or gas in a manner causing unnecessary water 05 channeling or coning; 06 (D) the operation of an oil well with an inefficient gas-oil ratio; 07 (E) the drowning with water of a pool or part of a pool capable 08 of producing oil or gas, except insofar as and to the extent authorized by the 09 commission; 10 (F) underground waste; 11 (G) the creation of unnecessary fire hazards; 12 (H) the release, burning, or escape into the open air of gas [,] 13 from a well producing oil or gas or from a pipeline carrying oil or gas, 14 except to the extent authorized by the commission; 15 (I) the use of gas for the manufacture of carbon black, except as 16 provided in this chapter; 17 (J) the drilling of wells unnecessary to carry out the purpose or 18 intent of this chapter. 19 * Sec. 2. AS 46.03.758(a) is amended to read: 20 (a) The legislature finds that 21 (1) [RECENT INFORMATION DISCLOSES THAT] the discharge of 22 oil may cause significant short and long-term damage to the state's environment; even 23 minute quantities of oil released to the environment may cause high mortalities among 24 larval and juvenile forms of important commercial species, may affect salmon 25 migration patterns, and may otherwise degrade and diminish the renewable resources 26 of the state; 27 (2) the exact nature and extent of oil pollution can be neither 28 documented with certainty nor precisely quantified on a spill-by-spill basis; however, 29 in light of the magnitude of harm that [WHICH] may be caused by oil discharges, and 30 the vital importance of commercial, sport, and subsistence fishing, tourism, and the 31 state's natural abundance and beauty to the economic future of the state and its quality 01 of life, it is the judgment of the legislature that substantial civil penalties should be 02 imposed for the discharge of oil in order to provide a meaningful incentive for the safe 03 handling of oil and to ensure [INSURE] that the public does not bear substantial 04 losses from oil pollution for which, because of its subtle, long-term, or unquantifiable 05 nature, compensation would not otherwise be received; and 06 (3) the handling of oil in large quantities is a hazardous undertaking 07 that poses a significant threat to the economy and environment of the state, which can 08 be substantially reduced only by the taking of rigorous safety precautions involving 09 considerable expense; conversely, persons handling oil in smaller amounts pose a 10 correspondingly lower risk to the economy and environment of the state, and are 11 capable of safe oil handling practices at correspondingly lower costs; in order to 12 provide an incentive that is effective, [BUT NOT PUNITIVE,] it is necessary and 13 appropriate that the assessment of [CIVIL] penalties for discharges of small quantities 14 of oil be left for case-by-case [JUDICIAL] determination, while ensuring, through the 15 penalty provisions of this section, that the handling of oil in large quantities occurs in 16 a manner that will not impair the renewable resources of the state. 17 * Sec. 3. AS 46.03.758(b) is amended to read: 18 (b) The [NO LATER THAN THE 10TH DAY AFTER THE CONVENING 19 OF THE SECOND SESSION OF THE TENTH ALASKA LEGISLATURE, THE] 20 department shall establish in [SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATURE] regulations 21 [ESTABLISHING] the following schedule of fixed penalties for discharges of oil: 22 (1) subject to (2) of this subsection, the penalties for the following 23 categories of receiving environments may not exceed 24 (A) $40 [$10] per gallon of oil that [WHICH] enters an 25 anadromous stream or other freshwater environment with significant aquatic 26 resources; 27 (B) $10 [$2.50] per gallon of oil that [WHICH] enters an 28 estuarine, intertidal or confined saltwater environment; and 29 (C) $4 [$1] per gallon of oil that [WHICH] enters an 30 unconfined saltwater environment, public land or freshwater environment 31 without significant aquatic resources; 01 (2) for discharges of oil that are caused by the gross negligence or 02 intentional act of the discharger, or when the court finds that the discharger did not 03 take reasonable measures to contain and clean up the discharged oil, the penalty shall 04 be determined by multiplying the penalty established under (1) of this subsection by a 05 factor of five. 06 * Sec. 4. AS 46.03.758 is amended by adding a new subsection to read: 07 (m) The department shall, every 10 years, increase the amounts of the civil 08 penalties authorized in (b) of this section by a percentage equal to the percentage of 09 increase in all items of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for urban 10 Alaska. The index for January of 2025 is the reference base index. 11 * Sec. 5. AS 46.03.759(a) is amended to read: 12 (a) A person who is found to be liable under any other state law for an 13 unpermitted discharge of crude oil in excess of 18,000 gallons is, in addition to 14 liability for any other penalties or for damages or the cost of containment and cleanup, 15 liable to the state in a civil action for a civil penalty, up to a maximum of 16 $500,000,000, in the amount of 17 (1) $20 [$8] per gallon of crude oil discharged for the first 420,000 18 gallons discharged; and 19 (2) $30 [$12.50] per gallon of crude oil discharged for amounts 20 discharged in excess of 420,000 gallons. 21 * Sec. 6.
